      <description>The General Directorate for the Cadastre of Spain has spatial information of the all buildings except for the Basque Country and Navarra. This data set is part of the implementation of INSPIRE, the Space Information Infrastructure in Europe. More information can be found here. We will use the links (urls) in ATOM format, which is an RSS type for web feeds, allowing us to obtain the download link for each municipality.</description>

      <description>Normally when we visualize monthly precipitation anomalies, we simply use a bar graph indicating negative and positive values with red and blue. However, it does not explain the general context of these anomalies. For example, what was the highest or lowest anomaly in each month? In principle, we could use a boxplot to visualize the distribution of the anomalies, but in this particular case they would not fit aesthetically, so we should look for an alternative.</description>

      <title>Tidy correlation tests in R</title>

      <description>When we try to estimate the correlation coefficient between multiple variables, the task is more complicated in order to obtain a simple and tidy result. A simple solution is to use the tidy() function from the {broom} package. In this post we are going to estimate the correlation coefficients between the annual precipitation of several Spanish cities and climate teleconnections indices: download. The data of the teleconnections are preprocessed, but can be downloaded directly from crudata.</description>
