      <description>When we visualize precipitation and temperature anomalies, we simply use time series as bar graph indicating negative and positive values in red and blue. However, in order to have a better overview we need both anomalies in a single graph. In this way we could more easly answer the question of whether a particular season or month was dry-warm or wet-cold, and even compare these anomalies in the context of previous years.</description>

      <description>The first post of this year 2020, I will dedicate to a question that I was recently asked. The question was how to calculate the shortest distance between different points and how to know which is the closest point. When we work with spatial data in R, currently the easiest thing is to use the sf package in combination with the tidyverse collection of packages. We also use the units package which is very useful for working with units of measurement.</description>

      <description>The General Directorate for the Cadastre of Spain has spatial information of the all buildings except for the Basque Country and Navarra. This data set is part of the implementation of INSPIRE, the Space Information Infrastructure in Europe. More information can be found here. We will use the links (urls) in ATOM format, which is an RSS type for web feeds, allowing us to obtain the download link for each municipality.</description>
