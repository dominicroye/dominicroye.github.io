      <description>Initial considerationsA disadvantage of choropleth maps is that they tend to distort the relationship between the true underlying geography and the represented variable. It is because the administrative divisions do not usually coincide with the geographical reality where people live. Besides, large areas appear to have a weight that they do not really have because of sparsely populated regions. To better reflect reality, more realistic population distributions are used, such as land use.</description>

      <description>Recently I was looking for a visual representation to show the daily changes of temperature, precipitation and wind in an application xeo81.shinyapps.io/MeteoExtremosGalicia (in Spanish), which led me to use a heatmap in the form of a calendar. The shiny application is updated every four hours with new data showing calendars for each weather station. The heatmap as a calendar allows you to visualize any variable with a daily time reference.</description>

      <description>In the field of data visualization, the animation of spatial data in its temporal dimension can show fascinating changes and patterns. As a result of one of the last publications in the social networks that I have made, I was asked to make a post about how I created it. Well, here we go to start with an example of data from mainland Spain. You can find more animations in the graphics section of my blog.</description>
