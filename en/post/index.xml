      <description>Recently I was looking for a visual representation to show the daily changes of temperature, precipitation and wind in an application xeo81.shinyapps.io/MeteoExtremosGalicia (in Spanish), which led me to use a heatmap in the form of a calendar. The shiny application is updated every four hours with new data showing calendars for each weather station. The heatmap as a calendar allows you to visualize any variable with a daily time reference.</description>

      <description>In the field of data visualization, the animation of spatial data in its temporal dimension can show fascinating changes and patterns. As a result of one of the last publications in the social networks that I have made, I was asked to make a post about how I created it. Well, here we go to start with an example of data from mainland Spain. You can find more animations in the graphics section of my blog.</description>

      <description>I recently created a visualization of the distribution of river flow directions and also of coastal orientations. Following its publication in social networks (here), I was asked to make a post about how I did it. Well, here we go to start with an example of rivers, coastal orientation is somewhat more complex. I did the same for a selection of European rivers here in this tweet. However, originally I started with the orientation of the European coasts.</description>
