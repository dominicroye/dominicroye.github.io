      <description>The tidyverse universe of packages, a collection of packages specially focused on data science, marked a milestone in R programming.

The most essential thing is that the first argument is the object and then come the rest of the arguments. In addition, a set of verbs is provided to facilitate the use of the functions. The tidyverse philosophy and grammar of functions structure is also reflected in other packages that make its use compatible with the collection of tidyverse.</description>
