      <description>I recently created a visualization of the distribution of river flow directions and also of coastal orientations. Following its publication in social networks (here), I was asked to make a post about how I did it. Well, here we go to start with an example of rivers, coastal orientation is somewhat more complex. I did the same for a selection of European rivers here in this tweet. However, originally I started with the orientation of the European coasts.</description>
