      <description>The first post of this year 2020, I will dedicate to a question that I was recently asked. The question was how to calculate the shortest distance between different points and how to know which is the closest point. When we work with spatial data in R, currently the easiest thing is to use the &lt;code&gt;sf&lt;/code&gt; package in combination with the &lt;code&gt;tidyverse&lt;/code&gt; collection of packages. We also use the &lt;code&gt;units&lt;/code&gt; package which is very useful for working with units of measurement.</description>

      <description>The distance to the sea is a fundamental variable in geography, especially relevant when it comes to modeling. For example, in interpolations of air temperature, the distance to the sea is usually used as a predictor variable, since there is a casual relationship between the two that explains the spatial variation. How can we estimate the (shortest) distance to the coast in R?</description>
