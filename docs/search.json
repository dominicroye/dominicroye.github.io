    "text": "Abstract\nWe all aim to use data to tell a compelling story, and many of us enjoy sharing how we got there by open-sourcing our code, but we don’t always share our story with everyone. Even kind, supportive, and open communities like the #TidyTuesday R learning community on Twitter has a ways to go before the content shared can be accessible to everyone.Lived experiences of blind R users tell us that most data visualizations shared for TidyTuesday are inaccessible to screen reading technology because they lack alternative text (i.e. alt text) descriptions. Our goal was to bring this hidden lack of accessibility to the surface by examining the alternative text accompanying data visualizations shared as part of the TidyTuesday social project.We scraped the alternative text from 6,443 TidyTuesday images posted on Twitter between April 2, 2018 and January 31, 2021. The first image attached to each tweet was considered the primary image and was scraped for alternative text. Manual web inspection revealed the CSS class and HTML element corresponding to the primary image, as well as the attribute containing the alternative text. We used this information and the ROpenSci {RSelenium} package to scrape the alternative text. Our preliminary analysis found that only 2.4% of the images contained a text description entered by the tweet author compared to 84% which were described by default as ‘Image.’This small group of intentional alternative text descriptions had a median word count of 18 (range: 1-170), and a median character count of 83 (range: 8-788). As a reference point, Twitter allows 240 characters in a single tweet and 1,000 characters for image descriptions. This analysis was made possible thanks to a dataset of historical TidyTuesday tweet data collected using the ROpenSci {rtweet} package, and openly available in the TidyTuesday GitHub repository.We will present during Session 0 on May 4, 2021: Crowdcast Link"

CCD Sips is a series of summer Wednesday evenings (4:30-7pm) filled with happy hour specials, between June 1st and August 31st.\nI prefer to take in this information as a map instead of a list, so I scraped some information from the website and made one! You can click or tap on the circle map markers to see information about each restaurant/bar along with a direct link to their posted happy hour specials.\nCheck out the link at the top of this post for a larger version of the interactive map below.

I wanted something more descriptive.\nThe map wasn’t mobile-responsive. In other words, the map markers and text looked too small when viewed on a mobile device.\n\n\nChanging the webpage title\nThe webpage title was a quick one to fix thanks to a Stack Overflow response to a question about turning off the title in an R Markdown document. The pagetitle YAML option lets you set the HTML’s title tag independently of the document title:\npagetitle: \"Philly CCD Sips 2022 Map\"\n\n\nFixing the mobile-responsiveness\nThe mobile-responsiveness issue could be solved by adding metadata to the map HTML, but I would need to be able to blend HTML with R code. I have been practicing using Quarto and figured I could make a standalone map from a Quarto document (.qmd) rather than an R Markdown one (.Rmd or .Rmarkdown). You can find the map’s Quarto document alongside this blog post.\nAccording to the Leaflet library documentation and this Stack Overflow answer, fixing the map to be mobile-responsive required adding the following metadata to the HTML code:\n&lt;meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no\" /&gt;\nI used the metathis R package to add this metadata to an R code chunk in my Quarto document using the meta_viewport() function:\n# make mobile-responsive\nmeta_viewport(\n  width = \"device-width\",\n  initial_scale = \"1.0\",\n  maximum_scale = \"1.0\",\n  user_scalable = \"no\"\n  )\n\nUpdate: In the process of updating this post I’m noticing that specifying the viewport metadata tag doesn’t seem to be necessary anymore, and I don’t understand why 🤔 …so I’ll leave the step as is, just in case it’s helpful to anyone 🤷🏽‍♀️\n\n\n\nAdding social media tags\nThen I added more metadata. I was particularly interested in adding social media tags so that if I (or anyone else) shared this map webpage, an informative preview would display as a social card.\nI used the meta_social() function to add these tags:\n# tags for social media\nmeta_social(\n  title = \"Philly CCD Sips 2022 Interactive Map\",\n  url = \"https://www.silviacanelon.com/blog/2022-ccd-sips/map.html\",\n  image = \"https://github.com/spcanelon/silvia/blob/main/content/blog/2022-05-31-ccd-sips/featured.png?raw=true\",\n  image_alt = \"Map of Philly's Center City with a pop-up saying Center City District Sips 2022\",\n  og_type = \"website\",\n  og_author = \"Silvia Canelón\",\n  twitter_card_type = \"summary_large_image\",\n  twitter_creator = \"@spcanelon\"\n)\nGreat, I had added all of the metadata I was interested in! Except that because I was using Quarto, and not one of the more common outputs I had a couple of extra steps to take:\n\nWrite my metadata tags to an HTML file, using the write_meta() function:\n# write meta tags to file\nwrite_meta(path = \"meta-map.html\")\nManually include this HTML in my webpage via the Quarto file. The include-in-header Quarto YAML option helped me here:\ninclude-in-header: meta-map.html\n\n\n\nMaking the map fullscreen\nA side effect of creating the map from a Quarto (or R Markdown) document is that the output is styled by default to fit within the width of an article (in this case 900 pixels). I wanted the map to take up the whole width of the page, so I made use of the page-layout Quarto YAML option:\nformat: \n  html:\n    page-layout: custom\nAnother option that worked pretty well was to use the column: screen code chunk option built into Quarto. The Quarto documentation even shows an example to display a Leaflet map I but it left a thin margin at the top margin, and I wanted the map to be flush against the top edge of the webpage.\n\n\nRendering the standalone map\nLastly, I added one more option to the YAML that would render the Quarto document into a self-contained HTML with all of the content needed to create the map.\nformat:\n  html:\n    page-layout: custom\n    self-contained: true"

Many thanks to Chief Editor Joe Rickert for a very encouraging and helpful editorial process! I am humbled by his note on R Views:\nSilvia’s post is a mini masterpiece of clear, concise writing that elucidates complex technology within the narrow context of explaining a single well-defined task. Silvia does not attempt to say everything she knows about the subject, and she resists digressions that might obscure the path she is laying out. It is an example of achieving clarity through saying less.\nThis post will guide you step-by-step through the process of creating an HTML xaringan slide deck and deploying it to the web for easy sharing with others. We will be using the xaringan package to build the slide deck, GitHub to help us host our slides for free with GitHub Pages, and the usethis package to help us out along the way. You will get the most out of this workflow if you are already familiar with R Markdown and GitHub, and if you have already connected RStudio (or your preferred IDE) to Git and GitHub.1 The post will not cover the nuts and bolts of xaringan or talk about slide design & customization, but you can find lots of learning resources listed at the end."

    "text": "Did you know that 97.4% of home pages have web accessibility failures??? 😱\nThis finding is one of many from an accessibility analysis that non-profit WebAIM (Web Accessibility in Mind) conducts annually on home pages of the top one million websites. You can find a summary of these findings in a WebAIM blog post and detailed information in the full report, both published on April 30, 2021.\nLearning about all of the ways that digital content is made inaccessible to people with disabilities has made me take inventory of the different ways that I have contributed to this problem (there was some shame to process here 🙈).\nThe magic of R Markdown has given me the gift of turning R code into a variety of HTML outputs including R notebooks, xaringan presentation slides, and websites like this one – all of which I’ve been able to share freely online with others. This magic though (like all magic?) comes with limitations. R tools (and technology more broadly) can’t automatically ensure that its various outputs are accessible to everyone. That’s where we come in as software developers and content creators and take personal responsibility. At the risk of extending this metaphor too far, I’ll finish by offering the framework that we all need to practice (accessibility) spells/skills in order to use these magical tools responsibly.\nAll of this to say that gaining awareness about accessibility as a way to create the more inclusive world that I want to live in has motivated me to do better. I even found myself excited to conduct accessibility audits on my digital content, including my personal website (data viz too)!"

If you need to migrate courses, I recommend taking a look at how Alison and Kelly Bodwin organized their courses and workshops into projects using this theme. I didn’t have projects prior to converting my site, but after creating a few projects post-Apéro I’m confident any projects you’ve created pre-Apéro will carry over easily.\n\nProjects on my site: https://silvia.rbind.io/project\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy Project listing: https://silvia.rbind.io/project\n\n\n\nIf you like videos, Alison recorded a walkthrough of this conversion process using Julia Silge’s site as an example.\nWhat not to expect\nA tutorial on how to create a Hugo Apéro site from scratch – but don’t worry! Alison covers this in a workshop she gave for R-Ladies Tunis and in the Get started series of blog posts included in the documentation site."

    "section": "Deploying your new site",
    "text": "Deploying your new site\nOnce you’re happy with your new Apéro site, the last step is to merge your apero branch with the primary branch of your website repository. But first, a few steps:\n\nOptional: Create a branch of your primary branch and call it hugo-academic so that you have a snapshot of your Academic files right before the merge. Since we set up Netlify to deploy all of our branches, there will now be a live link for this new branch that you can visit whenever you feel like time traveling back to your old site. For me this link is https://hugo-academic–silvia.netlify.app/\n\nSwitch back to your apero branch and update the baseURL field in config.toml to your regular website path. In my case:\nbaseURL = \"https://silvia.rbind.io/\"\nThen commit and push this change to your apero branch.\n\nMerge your apero branch with your primary branch. I usually use git commands in a combination of the RStudio terminal and the Git pane, but for this big merge I felt more comfortable doing it on github.com! :sweat_smile: Do what feels most comfortable for you.\n\nResolve any merge conflicts (I had a few!) in the git tool of your choosing. These are the git commands GitHub recommended:\ngit fetch origin       # makes sure local files were recent\ngit checkout apero     # moves you to your `apero` branch\ngit merge main         # attempts a merge with your `main` branch\nWhen you’re finished, commit your changes and push. Then follow these next steps, also recommended by GitHub:\ngit checkout main       # moves you to your `main` branch\ngit merge --no-ff apero # creates a new commit for the merge\nThis step will sort of replace all of the files that both themes had in common with the apero version (e.g. config.toml, netlify.toml, content/publication), and leave the old Academic files alone. So you will have to delete these extra Academic files (again!). I’m not sure how to avoid this – maybe it’s not an issue when you don’t have merge conflicts? I don’t know :thinking:\n\n\nTidy up your directory (again?)\nGo through the steps above to clean out any residual Academic files from your directory. Make sure to check your content/ folders for any example files from Academic that might still be hanging around and delete them.\nThen run blogdown::serve_site() to build your new Apéro site locally. Go through the site and make sure everything looks the way it should and that links are generally pointing to the right places.\nWhen you’re satisfied, commit the changes to your primary branch!There may be a lot of files that were deleted and added during the switch to Apéro and, while not generally recommended, I used the git add . command to stage all of the changes at once, commited the changes, and then pushed. I did this after thoroughly looking through the list of changed files so I knew what was happening.\n\nWait a couple of minutes for the changes to get pushed to your primary branch (e.g. main) and then wait patiently for Netlify to build your site after the merge.\n Celebrate and share your brand new site! 🎉 🥳 🍾If you share on Twitter, use the #HugoApero hashtag so the Hugo Apéro squad can clap for you!"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Importance. Relative to what is known about pregnancy complications and sickle cell disease (SCD), little is known about the risk of pregnancy complications among those with sickle cell trait (SCT). There is a lack of clinical research among sickle cell carriers largely due to low sample sizes and disparities in research funding.\nObjective. To evaluate whether there is an association between SCT and a stillbirth outcome.\nDesign, Setting, and Participants. This retrospective cohort study included data on deliveries occurring between January 1, 2010, and August 15, 2017, at 4 quaternary academic medical centers within the Penn Medicine health system in Pennsylvania. The population included a total of 2482 deliveries from 1904 patients with SCT but not SCD, and 215 deliveries from 164 patients with SCD. Data were analyzed from May 3, 2019, to September 16, 2021.\nExposures. The primary exposure of interest was SCT, identified using clinical diagnosis codes recorded in the electronic health record.\nMain Outcomes and Measures. A multivariate logistic regression model was constructed to assess the risk of stillbirth using the following risk factors: SCD, numbers of pain crises and blood transfusions before delivery, delivery episode (as a proxy for parity), prior cesarean delivery, multiple gestation, patient age, marital status, race and ethnicity, ABO blood type, Rhesus (Rh) factor, and year of delivery.\nResults. This cohort study included 50 560 patients (63 334 deliveries), most of whom were aged 25 to 34 years (29 387 of 50 560 [58.1%]; mean [SD] age, 29.5 [6.1] years), were single at the time of delivery (28 186 [55.8%]), were Black or African American (23 777 [47.0%]), had ABO blood type O (22 879 [45.2%]), and were Rhesus factor positive (44 000 [87.0%]). From this general population, 2068 patients (4.1%) with a sickle cell gene variation were identified: 1904 patients (92.1%) with SCT (2482 deliveries) and 164 patients (7.9%) with SCD (215 deliveries). In the fully adjusted model, SCT was associated with an increased risk of stillbirth (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 8.94; 95% CI, 1.05-75.79; P = .045) while adjusting for the risk factors of SCD (aOR, 26.40; 95% CI, 2.48-280.90; P = .007) and multiple gestation (aOR, 4.68; 95% CI, 3.48-6.29; P &lt; .001).\nConclusions and Relevance. The results of this large, retrospective cohort study indicate an increased risk of stillbirth among pregnant people with SCT. These findings underscore the need for additional risk assessment during pregnancy for sickle cell carriers.\n\n\n\nDirected Acyclic Graph With Stillbirth as the Outcome and Sickle Cell Trait (SCT) as the Primary Exposure of Interest.\n\n\n\n\nAlternative Figure 2\n\n\n\n\nAlternative Directed Acyclic Graph With Stillbirth as the Outcome and Sickle Cell Trait (SCT) as the Primary Exposure of Interest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nElectronic Health Records (EHR) contain detailed information about a patient’s medical history and can be helpful in understanding clinical outcomes among populations generally underrepresented in research, including pregnant individuals. A cesarean delivery is a clinical outcome often considered in studies as an adverse pregnancy outcome, when in reality there are circumstances in which a cesarean delivery is considered the safest or best choice given the patient’s medical history, situation, and comfort. Rather than consider all cesarean deliveries to be negative outcomes, it is important to examine other risk factors that may contribute to a cesarean delivery being an adverse event. Looking at emergency admissions can be a useful way to ascertain whether or not a cesarean delivery is part of an adverse event. This study utilizes EHR data from Penn Medicine to assess patient characteristics and pregnancy-related conditions as risk factors for an emergency admission at the time of delivery. After adjusting for pregnancy number and cesarean number for each patient, preterm birth increased risk of an emergency admission, and patients younger than 25, or identifying as Black/African American, Asian, or Other/Mixed, had an increased risk. Later pregnancies and repeat cesareans decreased the risk of an emergency delivery, and White, Hispanic, and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander patients were at decreased risk. The same risk factors and trends were found among cesarean deliveries, except that Asian patients did not have an increased risk, and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander patients did not have a reduced risk in this group.\n\n\n\n2021 PSB Poster (letter)"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Bone is a composite material made up of an inorganic (hydroxyapatite mineral) phase, a proteinaceous organic phase, and water. Comprising 90% of bone’s organic phase, type I collagen is the most abundant protein in the human body. Both hydroxyapatite and collagen contribute to bone mechanical properties, and because bone is a hierarchical material, changes in properties of either phase can influence bulk mechanical properties of the tissue and bone structure. Type I collagen in bone is synthesized by osteoblasts as a helical structure formed from three polypeptide chains of amino acids. These molecules are staggered into an array and the resulting collagen fibrils are stabilized by crosslinks. Enzymatic crosslinking can be limited by compounds such as β-aminopropionitrile (BAPN) and result in a crosslink deficiency characterizing a disease known as lathyrism. BAPN acts by irreversibly binding to the active site of the lysyl oxidase enzyme, blocking the formation of new crosslinks and the maturation of pre-existing immature crosslinks. Understanding how changes in bone properties on a cellular level transcend levels of bone hierarchy provides an opportunity to detect or diagnose bone disease before disease-related changes are expressed at the organ or tissue level. This dissertation studies the in vitro effect of BAPN-induced enzymatic crosslink reduction on osteoblast-produced collagen nanostructure, mechanical properties, crosslink ratio, and expression of genes related to type I collagen synthesis and crosslinking. The work also explores the effect of mechanical loading via applied substrate strain on these properties to investigate its potential compensatory impact."

Logistic regression modeling evaluated individual-level risk factors for severe maternal morbidity, such as maternal age and preeclampsia diagnosis. Additionally, we used spatial autoregressive modeling to assess Census-tract, neighborhood-level risk factors for severe maternal morbidity such as violent crime and poverty.\nResults: Overall, 63,334 pregnancies were included, with a severe maternal morbidity rate of 2.73%, or 272 deliveries with severe maternal morbidity per 10,000 delivery hospitalizations. In our multivariable model assessing individual-level risk factors for severe maternal morbidity, the magnitude of risk was highest for patients with a cesarean delivery (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 3.50, 95% CI 3.15-3.89), stillbirth (aOR 4.60, 95% CI 3.31-6.24), and preeclampsia diagnosis (aOR 2.71, 95% CI 2.41-3.03). Identifying as White was associated with lower odds of severe maternal morbidity at delivery (aOR 0.73, 95% CI 0.61-0.87). In our final multivariable model assessing neighborhood-level risk factors for severe maternal morbidity, the rate of severe maternal morbidity increased by 2.4% (95% CI 0.37-4.4%) with every 10% increase in the percentage of individuals in a Census tract who identified as Black or African American when accounting for the number of violent crimes and percentage of people identifying as White.\nConclusion: Both individual-level and neighborhood-level risk factors were associated with severe maternal morbidity. These factors may contribute to rising severe maternal morbidity rates in the United States. Better characterization of risk factors for severe maternal morbidity is imperative for the design of clinical and public health interventions seeking to lower rates of severe maternal morbidity and maternal mortality."

A systematic literature review was performed regarding the timing of menarche and four publication databases were interrogated: EMBASE, SCOPUS, PubMed, and Cochrane Reviews. Themes were identified from 112 articles and related to environmental causes of perturbations in menarche (either early or late), disease causes and consequences of perturbations, and social causes and consequences.

    "text": "Background. Medication-wide association studies (MWAS) have been applied to assess the risk of individual prescription use and a wide range of health outcomes, including cancer, acute myocardial infarction, acute liver failure, acute renal failure, and upper gastrointestinal ulcers. Current literature on the use of preconception and periconception medication and its association with the risk of multiple gestation pregnancies (eg, monozygotic and dizygotic) is largely based on assisted reproductive technology (ART) cohorts. However, among non-ART pregnancies, it is unknown whether other medications increase the risk of multifetal pregnancies.\nObjective. This study aimed to investigate the risk of multiple gestational births (eg., twins and triplets) following preconception and periconception exposure to prescription medications in patients who delivered at Penn Medicine.\nMethods. We used electronic health record data between 2010 and 2017 on patients who delivered babies at Penn Medicine, a health care system in the Greater Philadelphia area. We explored 3 logistic regression models: model 1 (no adjustment); model 2 (adjustment for maternal age); and model 3—our final logistic regression model (adjustment for maternal age, ART use, and infertility diagnosis). In all models, multiple births (MBs) were our outcome of interest (binary outcome), and each medication was assessed separately as a binary variable. To assess our MWAS model performance, we defined ART medications as our gold standard, given that these medications are known to increase the risk of MB.\nResults. Of the 63,334 distinct deliveries in our cohort, only 1877 pregnancies (2.96%) were prescribed any medication during the preconception and first trimester period.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Background. Medication-wide association studies (MWAS) have been applied to assess the risk of individual prescription use and a wide range of health outcomes, including cancer, acute myocardial infarction, acute liver failure, acute renal failure, and upper gastrointestinal ulcers. Current literature on the use of preconception and periconception medication and its association with the risk of multiple gestation pregnancies (eg, monozygotic and dizygotic) is largely based on assisted reproductive technology (ART) cohorts. However, among non-ART pregnancies, it is unknown whether other medications increase the risk of multifetal pregnancies.\nObjective. This study aimed to investigate the risk of multiple gestational births (eg., twins and triplets) following preconception and periconception exposure to prescription medications in patients who delivered at Penn Medicine.\nMethods. We used electronic health record data between 2010 and 2017 on patients who delivered babies at Penn Medicine, a health care system in the Greater Philadelphia area. We explored 3 logistic regression models: model 1 (no adjustment); model 2 (adjustment for maternal age); and model 3—our final logistic regression model (adjustment for maternal age, ART use, and infertility diagnosis). In all models, multiple births (MBs) were our outcome of interest (binary outcome), and each medication was assessed separately as a binary variable. To assess our MWAS model performance, we defined ART medications as our gold standard, given that these medications are known to increase the risk of MB.\nResults. Of the 63,334 distinct deliveries in our cohort, only 1877 pregnancies (2.96%) were prescribed any medication during the preconception and first trimester period. Of the 123 medications prescribed, we found 26 (21.1%) medications associated with MB (using nominal P values) and 10 (8.1%) medications associated with MB (using Bonferroni adjustment) in fully adjusted model 3. We found that our model 3 algorithm had an accuracy of 85% (using nominal P values) and 89% (using Bonferroni-adjusted P values).\nConclusions. Our work demonstrates the opportunities in applying the MWAS approach with electronic health record data to explore associations between preconception and periconception medication exposure and the risk of MB while identifying novel candidate medications for further study. Overall, we found 3 novel medications linked with MB that could be explored in further work; this demonstrates the potential of our method to be used for hypothesis generation.\n\n\n\nA graphical overview of the medication-wide association study analyses on multiple birth."

    "text": "Type I collagen morphology can be characterized using fibril D-spacing, a metric which describes the periodicity of repeating bands of gap and overlap regions of collagen molecules arranged into collagen fibrils. This fibrillar structure is stabilized by enzymatic crosslinks initiated by lysyl oxidase (LOX), a step which can be disrupted using β-aminopropionitrile (BAPN). Murine in vivo studies have confirmed effects of BAPN on collagen nanostructure and the objective of this study was to evaluate the mechanism of these effects in vitro by measuring D-spacing, evaluating the ratio of mature to immature crosslinks, and quantifying gene expression of type I collagen and LOX. Osteoblasts were cultured in complete media, and differentiated using ascorbic acid, in the presence or absence of 0.25mM BAPN-fumarate. The matrix produced was imaged using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and 2D Fast Fourier transforms were performed to extract D-spacing from individual fibrils. The experiment was repeated for quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analyses. The D-spacing distribution of collagen produced in the presence of BAPN was shifted toward higher D-spacing values, indicating BAPN affects the morphology of collagen produced in vitro, supporting aforementioned in vivo experiments. In contrast, no difference in gene expression was found for any target gene, suggesting LOX inhibition does not upregulate the LOX gene to compensate for the reduction in aldehyde formation, or regulate expression of genes encoding type I collagen. Finally, the mature to immature crosslink ratio decreased with BAPN treatment and was linked to a reduction in peak percent area of mature crosslink hydroxylysylpyridinoline (HP). In conclusion, in vitro treatment of osteoblasts with low levels of BAPN did not induce changes in genes encoding LOX or type I collagen, but led to an increase in collagen D-spacing as well as a decrease in mature crosslinks."

    "text": "Enzymatic crosslinks stabilize type I collagen and are catalyzed by lysyl oxidase (LOX), a step interrupted through β-aminopropionitrile (BAPN) exposure. This study evaluated dose-dependent effects of BAPN on osteoblast gene expression of type I collagen, LOX, and genes associated with crosslink formation. The second objective was to characterize collagen produced in vitro after exposure to BAPN, and to explore changes to collagen properties under continuous cyclical substrate strain. To evaluate dose-dependent effects, osteoblasts were exposed to a range of BAPN dosages (0–10 mM) for gene expression analysis and cell proliferation. Results showed significant upregulation of BMP-1, POST, and COL1A1 and change in cell proliferation. Results also showed that while the gene encoding LOX was unaffected by BAPN treatment, other genes related to LOX activation and matrix production were upregulated. For the loading study, the combined effects of BAPN and mechanical loading were assessed. Gene expression was quantified, atomic force microscopy was used to extract elastic properties of the collagen matrix, and Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy was used to assess collagen secondary structure for enzymatic crosslinking analysis. BAPN upregulated BMP-1 in static samples and BAPN combined with mechanical loading downregulated LOX when compared to control-static samples. Results showed a higher indentation modulus in BAPN-loaded samples compared to control-loaded samples. Loading increased the mature-to-immature crosslink ratios in control samples, and BAPN increased the height ratio in static samples. In summary, effects of BAPN (upregulation of genes involved in crosslinking, mature/immature crosslinking ratios, upward trend in collagen elasticity) were mitigated by mechanical loading."

    "text": "Asking around\nIn the interest of making an informed decision, I asked a few instructors to share a bit about their experience with the certification process before I made the commitment.\n\n🇺🇸 Stephan Kadauke is a colleague I met through the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia R User group. Specifically at an Intro to Machine Learning with the Tidyverse workshop led by Alison Hill.\n\nI met these wonderful people through the R-Ladies Global Slack workspace:\n\n🇦🇷 Yanina Bellini Saibene shared her experience with this process in her blog post Obtaining RStudio certification. A shared path.\n🇧🇴 🇳🇱 Paloma Rojas-Saunero shared her view as a Ph.D. candidate with experience teaching R in R-Ladies workshops and as a teaching assistant in biostatistics courses.\n🇰🇪 Shelmith Kariuki speaks to her experience in her blog post The RStudio Certification Process.\n\n\nHere’s what folks had to say!\nHighlights are shared with the authors’ permission and my gratitude to them.\n\nWhat made you want to pursue the certification?\n\nOne, it gave me incentive to read R for Data Science cover to cover which I had been meaning to do for a while. Two, I’m teaching R and the certification gives me some gravitas to do that. Three, it forced me to critically think about cognitive load theory, concept mapping, and lesson development, all of which are super useful when you actually have to develop lessons. –Stephan\n\n\nI pursued the certification for a few reasons. First because I am really enthusiastic about teaching and I love the tidyverse, so I wanted to find opportunities of teaching it outside my university. Second because I feel that RStudio is growing so fast on teaching materials that sharing with other instructors would be a great way to always keep updated. And last but not least, I was also encouraged by the idea of going through the process with Yanina Bellini Saibene and other amazing women as she discusses in her blog post. –Paloma\n\n\n\nWhat did you think of the training itself, particularly the pedagogical aspects?\n\nThe training is top notch. In my mind, Greg Wilson is the #1 authority when it comes to teaching programming and R in particular. –Stephan\n\n\nI think the best part is to take and learn the pedagogical aspect. Greg Wilson is an awesome trainer and you will love as a student all the tools and techniques that he teaches you. For learning this, the course is already worth it. All the content is more developed in the book Teaching Tech Together by Greg Wilson if you want to look it over. –Yanina\n\n\nAbout the training, it was mind blowing, it changed my view of teaching not only programming but everything. Greg’s book is amazing and the way he teaches is outstanding. I learned so much. –Paloma\n\n\n\nHave you been able to implement what you learned in some way either at work or elsewhere?\n\nYes! As you probably saw, I’m teaching the intro to R course for R/Medicine. And I’ve been teaching a similar course to doctors, in addition to some other teaching sessions that I’ve done for the CHOP R User group and/or medical resident teaching. –Stephan\n\n\nYes! Immediately. I delivered 3 in-person courses after training and more than 15 courses on-line using all the pedagogical tools. I also co-founded Metadocencia where we share practical tools to help teachers teach online (volunteer-run and free) using these principles learned in the training. I also use some of the tools for my work as the chief of a research group for some meetings and identifying the target of some of our development (especially concept maps and learner personas). –Yanina\n\n\nI think I use what I learned so far even when I am preparing my work presentations, when developing any type of class, event, book club, etc. Overall it was an experience that made me reflect a lot on how teaching is usually done, how is my teaching so far and an inspiration about the teacher I want to be. –Paloma"

In that spirit, I’ll add my own glowing recommendation:\n\nGreg Wilson is truly a programming pedagogy expert, and an incredibly kind human being. I’m grateful to have learned from him within the context of the certification, and appreciate being able to continue learning from his example in a variety of other contexts.\n\nNevertheless, I’m glad I got to do a gut-check beforehand when I attended the RStudio Instructor Certification Panel hosted by the MiR Community and facilitated by Dorris Scott and Danielle Smalls-Perkins. You’ll notice Yanina and Shelmith were two of the panelists! Hearing from this panel was the last piece of the puzzle I needed to feel like pursuing the certification was an enthusiastic yes."

They include the slides below and this R Markdown file that I used to incorporate live coding into the lesson.\nI found an excellent reference for a demonstration lesson in Florencia D’Andrea’s post Two examples of iteration with purrr - Class for the RStudio certification.\nIt comes highly recommended that someone take a look at each one of our lessons before it ships out because it seems it’s common not to realize we’ve packed too much in! Yanina was kind enough to sit through my lesson as a learner and provided fantastic feedback. Some of the things I was able to work on before my teaching exam included providing context for the lesson at the beginning (asking the learner to download the file, introducing the lesson in the context of a workshop, etc.) and talking through all my key strokes during the live coding portions.

Yanina joined us for some of the sessions to lend us her expertise and provide tips and tricks!\nOne of the recommendations Yanina made was to explore the RStudio Primers for any topic we wanted to practice. For me that meant iteration using purrr’s map functions. After the iteration primer and the companion R for Data Science chapter, I felt like I could iterate all day every day.\nIn real life, both the written portion of the teaching exam and the Tidyverse exam are very much like the sample exams provided on the RStudio Education blog. You can find those here:\n\nSample exam v1.0 (February 2020): Instructor Certification Exams\nSample exam v2.0 (August 2020): More sample exams\n\nIf you’re a member of the MiR Community and like the idea of studying with some structure and friendly accountability, join us for the study group!

    "section": "Why port to Quarto?",
    "text": "Why port to Quarto?\nQuarto is a new and powerful technical publishing system in active development, natively friendly to a variety of programming languages and IDEs. There are countless features available in Quarto that I was interested in having access to in my website, so I’ll list just my top five:\n\nFlexibility in design. Quarto offers options for website navigation (top navigation vs. side navigation), “about” pages like the postcard landing pages that a lot of folks use in their distill sites, listing pages that are generated from a list of documents, among others. These components would act like modules that I could combine to design a site that truly fit my needs.\nFlexibility in content layout. With Quarto I would gain the ability to organize content in ways I hadn’t even dreamt of. Tables and figures could be laid out across multiple columns and rows as sub-tables and sub-figures of a panel. How much of the page the content took up would be up to me. Content could even go in the margin! 🤩 \nFreezing computations. Quarto would give me the option to freeze posts containing executable code. This was huge for me, because updating my blogdown site always produced a little bit of anxiety. I used to worry that blogdown might try to re-render old R Markdown blog posts and break things! 😱\nSite search. With content spread out over blog posts, talks, publications, and projects, I wanted site visitors (including myself!) to be able to keyword search for something in particular. Tags and categories in blogdown would get me part of the way there, but Quarto offers built-in search capability.\nEmbedding computations. Ok this is a feature that I learned about a week ago at posit::conf(2023) from Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel’s talk “Reproducible Manuscripts with Quarto.” Mine demo’d pulling a table from a .qmd file and a figure from an .ipynb file into the same manuscript .qmd file, without having to execute the source code again! 👀 This is a game changer for anyone compiling results from computations performed in different files, and in my personal site I could see it coming in handy if I have a series of blog posts with outputs that I want to cross-reference. Currently we can only embed computations from Jupyter notebook files, but hopefully we’ll be able to embed .qmd computations in Quarto v1.4! 🤞🏽\nI mean, it’s pretty cool that content can go in the margin, right??  It could even be a picture: The book page reads verdere expedities which is Dutch for “further expeditions”"

    "text": "The cost of porting\nGaining the aforementioned Quarto functionality did not come without a cost. To me, the biggest cost was the aesthetics – the Hugo Apéro theme is quite lovely! – but I customized my Quarto site enough to reflect the design aspects I loved the most. More on styling later. Some other costs included:\n\n\nLoss of the sidebar layout. The Apéro theme has options for adding a nicely styled sidebar that I had been using for my blog. It included a featured image and details about the individual post like tags, categories, length, etc. All of this information is available in Quarto posts, it’s just organized a little differently.\nExample of the sidebar\n\n\n\n\nLoss of Utterances comments. Any interactions with folks through Utteranc.es comments did not transfer over, and I’ll miss them. The few comments on my site have been very kind (see example below) and I’ve really enjoy reading them!\nExample of Utterances comments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate: Oct. 12, 2023\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks to Emily Riederer, I’m happy to report this is a non-issue! See her tips in the comments at the end of the post, or on GitHub.\n\n\n\n\nHugo Apéro collections. The Apéro theme had a way of bundling together posts that were related into a collection of posts. Garrick and I used this feature for our user!2021 xaringan workshop and it worked well to organize learning materials for different sections of our workshop. If I wanted something like this in the future, I would probably use Quarto’s sidebar navigation feature like Andrew Bray did in his Rmd to Quarto workshop for rstudio::conf(2022).\nName pronunciation on the About page. Apéro had a built-in option for adding an audio clip under your name that you could use to help people learn how your name is pronounced. I never used this feature myself, but if I wanted to, I could look to Emil Hvitfeldt’s site as an example.\nRedirects. The Apéro theme gave me the option to define the combination of date information and URL slugs for each of my posts, and I had them set up as year-slug (e.g., blog/2023-hello-quarto). Quarto does not offer that functionality and strictly creates URLs for posts based on the filepath (e.g., blog/2023-09-29-hello-quarto). In order to continue using my year-month-day-slug naming convention for my post folders, I had to set up redirects from the old URLs to the new ones so that there wouldn’t be broken links sprinkled throughout the internet. More on redirects later."

I used an about page layout for both my home and about pages, and listing pages to generate a list of blog posts, talks, publications, and projects. There was also some custom CSS involved, but we haven’t gotten to that part of the blog post yet wink 😉 Dear reader, it’s at this point in my blog post drafting that I start realizing that what was meant to be a brief post is turning into a novel (sigh)\nOne of the aspects I liked about my Apéro site was that the About page highlighted the most recent posts from the blog, talk, publication, and project groups. In my Quarto site, I achieved this by including a one-entry listing grid for each group on my About page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCSS tip\n\n\n\n\n\nThese listing cards looked great on a wide screen but as the screen got narrower (think mobile device) the listing cards just became narrower and narrower 😂.

I saw a great example on Michael McCarthy’s Tidy Tales blog, site and did a little repo-diving to get ideas on how to organize the content. I ended up using the Bootstrap CSS Grid to layout the content exactly how I wanted to. See what I mean about Quarto offering a lot of flexibility in content layout?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBones of the contact page\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncontact.qmd\n\n\n&lt;!-- start grid --&gt;\n::: {.grid} \n\n&lt;!-- column for the body text --&gt;\n::: {.g-col-5}\n\n# Send me a note\n\n&lt; Body text&gt;\n\n&lt; HTML code for social media icons &gt;\n\n:::\n\n&lt;!-- column for spacing --&gt;\n::: {.g-col-1}\n:::\n\n&lt;!-- column for the form --&gt;\n::: {.g-col-6}\n\n&lt; HTML embed code provided by Formspree &gt;\n\n:::\n\n:::\n&lt;!-- end grid --&gt;\n\n source code"

    "text": "Adapting old posts\nYAML fields\nOk so once I figured out how to incorporate all of the structural elements I wanted, I had to deal with the (relatively small) challenge of porting my old posts to Quarto. Quarto was designed to be compatible with existing R Markdown documents, but I didn’t actually want it trying to re-render old R Markdown files so I had Quarto ignore those completely2 and render the Markdown version of each post instead3. There were also a handful of YAML fields that I had to remove or modify to play nicely with Quarto:\n\nRemove layout: (e.g., layout: single-sidebar)\nRemove publishDate\n\nRemove lastUpdated\n\nRemove featured (e.g., featured: yes)\nMerge categories with tags and keep tags\n\nAdd image (e.g. image: featured.png)\nPartials\nIf you’ve used Apéro you might have come to love the cute button links created from the links field in the YAML, like the one at the top of this post, pointing to the Quarto docs.\nlinks:\n- icon: journal-text\n  name: Quarto Docs\n  url: https://quarto.org/docs/websites/\nWell, these button links are not ready-made by Quarto, but lucky for me (us!), Garrick figured out a way to bring them in right where we I need them. I repo-dived and found that he modified an HTML partial for title blocks, which controls the layout and styling of the post title, description, and tags, shown at the top of the page.\nThe original title block partial has sections controlling the placement and styling of text provided in the title, subtitle, authors, date, and abstract fields of the document YAML.\nAs an example, line 2 might read:If there’s something in the title field of the YAML, give it a level 1 heading and style it with CSS class .title\n\n\ngithub.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/src/resources/formats/html/pandoc/title-block.html\n\n&lt;header id=\"title-block-header\"&gt;\n$if(title)$&lt;h1 class=\"title\"&gt;$title$&lt;/h1&gt;$endif$\n$if(subtitle)$\n&lt;p class=\"subtitle\"&gt;$subtitle$&lt;/p&gt;\n$endif$\n$for(author)$\n&lt;p class=\"author\"&gt;$author$&lt;/p&gt;\n$endfor$\n\n$if(date)$\n&lt;p class=\"date\"&gt;$date$&lt;/p&gt;\n$endif$\n$if(abstract)$\n&lt;div class=\"abstract\"&gt;\n&lt;div class=\"abstract-title\"&gt;$abstract-title$&lt;/div&gt;\n$abstract$\n&lt;/div&gt;\n$endif$\n&lt;/header&gt;\n\nThe modified partial  includes some additional sections but I’ll break down the one for links.\nThere’s more styling going on in the modified partial, but starting on line 6, the structure for the link buttons is effectively:If the links field is populated in the YAML, create an HTML container styled by some CSS, and give it some specific HTML properies.Then, for each sub-item of the links field: create a hyperlink from the url sub-item, apply some CSS classes to create the button, add a Bootstrap icon defined by the icon sub-item, and finally add hyperlink text defined by the name sub-item.\n\n\n_partials/title-block-link-buttons/title-block.html\n\n&lt;header id=\"title-block-header\" class=\"quarto-title-block default page-columns\"&gt;\n...\n$if(links)$\n&lt;div class=\"mt-4 d-flex flex-row flex-wrap gap-1 justify-content-left justify-content-sm-start\" role=\"group\" aria-label=\"Links\"&gt;\n$for(links)$\n&lt;a href=\"$links.url$\" class=\"btn btn-secondary text-capitalize\"&gt;&lt;i class=\"bi bi-$links.icon$ me-1\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;$links.name$&lt;/a&gt;\n$endfor$\n&lt;/div&gt;\n$endif$\n...\n&lt;/header&gt;"

    "section": "Styling the site",
    "text": "Styling the site\nSCSS variables\nI may have published my brand new Quarto site in the fall of 2023, but I had actually taken my first go at porting it from Apéro in the fall of 2022. In an attempt to replicate the styling of my old site I tried to strong-arm my Quarto site into using tachyons4, and I wrote way too much custom CSS in the process 😩.\nSomething didn’t feel right about it, so I took a break and came back to my in-progress Quarto site several months later – outside of the Quarto release craze, and with the perspective that I wanted to work with the built-in theming capabilities, rather than against them 😌. This time around I leaned into the Bootstrap SCSS variables, and added custom styling as needed.\nTo be more specific, I created a custom theme 5, and populated it with definitions for some of the built-in Bootstrap Sass variables. If you poke around my custom theme, you will notice that some colors are defined by color variables that start with $spc-. These are variables pointing to colors that I’ve defined elsewhere, and they can be replaced with a hex code of your choosing! 🎨\n\n\nassets/silvia-theme.scss\n\n/*-- scss:defaults --*/\n\n// Colors\n$primary:                    $spc-primary-light;\n$secondary:                  $spc-secondary;\n\nThe Sass variables listed in the documentation got me pretty far, but there were still elements of my site using default colors and styling that I wanted to change. So I repo-dived to learn about additional Quarto Bootstrap variables and rules:\n\nBootstrap variables: https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/blob/main/src/resources/formats/html/bootstrap/_bootstrap-variables.scss\n\nBootstrap rules: https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-cli/blob/main/src/resources/formats/html/bootstrap/_bootstrap-rules.scss\n\n\nTo give you an example, someone in the Quarto Discussions forum asked how to set the color of block quotes, figure captions, and outlines, something not defined in the documentation. One of the replies suggested using the browser’s inspector to find the CSS rule applied to the element in question, we’ll say the figure caption, and then looking at how Quarto implemented that rule. I’ll make that process a little more explicit here and use the figure caption as an example:\n\nUse the browser inspector to highlight a figure caption\nThe inspector will reveal that the element is styled by CSS class .figure-caption\nRun a keyword search for “figure-caption” in the Bootstrap variables file. This will yield no results 🤔\n\nRun the same keyword search in the Bootstrap rules file – success! We have a clue, which is that .figure-caption is styled by a variable named body-secondary 🔍\n.panel-caption,\n.figure-caption,\n.subfigure-caption,\n.table-caption,\nfigcaption.quarto-float-caption,\ncaption {\n  font-size: 0.9rem;\n  @include body-secondary;\n}\n\n\nDefine your own body-secondary color variable in your custom theme file\n\n\nassets/custom-theme.scss\n\n/*-- scss:defaults --*/\n\n$body-secondary: #6C757D;\n\n\nEnjoy the fruits of your labor as a CSS detective 🕵🏽‍♀️\nIndividual page styling\nIn some cases, I wanted to style individual pages differently than I was styling my entire site. Poking around Garrick’s repo (again!), I learned that you can reference CSS stylesheets in the YAML of any particular document. I used this approach to separately style my Home, About, and listing pages.\n\n\nindex.qmd\n\nexecute: \n  freeze: false\n  echo: false\n  warning: false\n\n\n\nindex.qmd  source code\n\n\nassets/index.css  source code\n\nBackground image for title blocks\nOk one of the aesthetic pieces I was excited to add to my Quarto site that I didn’t have in my old site is a featured image at the top of each post. I was inspired by Matt Worthington’s site while I was reading one of his excellent blog posts on a workflow for interactive maps in R – I loved that the title block included an image in the background! 🤩\nAfter some web inspecting and repo-diving in Matt’s website repo I came up with some styling that I could apply to the title block of each post. It took modifying the title block partial described earlier, and adding some CSS to my custom theme.\nFor styling that I wanted to apply uniformly to all post title blocks, I created a .featured-image CSS class in my custom theme:\nDon’t miss the code annotations for this code chunk! 👀 Such a cool feature!\n\n\nassets/custom-theme.scss\n\n  // style background image on posts\n  .featured-image {\n1    background-size: cover;\n2    background-position: center;\n3    color: white;\n4    box-shadow: inset 0 0 0 1000px rgba(0,38,66,0.75);\n  }\n\n\n1\n\nHave the image cover the background\n\n2\n\nCenter the image\n\n3\n\nMake the overlaying text color white\n\n4\n\nAdd shadowing that gives the appearance of a dark overlay\n\n\nAlright, but why didn’t I use a background-image property to define the image? If I define the background image in my .featured-image class then that is the image that’s going to show up in all of the posts across my site. I want the title block of each post to display the featured image belonging to each individual post. That’s where the partial comes back in.\n\n\n_partials/title-block-link-buttons/title-block.html\n\n&lt;div \nid=\"title-block-header-title\" \nclass=\"quarto-title page-columns page-full page-layout-full featured-image p-4\" \nstyle=\"background-image: url(featured.png), url(featured.jpg), url(../featured.jpg);\"&gt;\n...\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\nAlong with some other CSS classes, the div container for the title block is styled with the featured-image class defined earlier, using the class= property. In addition, the div itself is styled using the style= property, and that’s where I defined the background image. The partial will look for a featured image of some kind either in the same folder as the post, or in the parent folder, and display it in the background of the title block.\nThis is a hacky way of getting what I really want which is for the partial to check for a featured image in the order I specify and then just stop once it finds one. As it stands right now, the styling attempts to layer on all three images, with the first image on the top and the last image on the bottom. This means that I get a warning every time I preview or render my site because the partial can’t find one or two of the other urls, but I’m ok with that!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample warning\n\n\n\n/blog/2023-09-29-hello-quarto/featured.png (404: Not Found)"

I placed this code within my home page index.qmd file  and I specified freeze: false in the YAML so that the code would run each time I rendered the site. The following sections will take a look at the code piece by piece.\nImporting manual redirects\nThe first step imports the manually-defined redirects that I had already been using in my old site. These redirects primarily have the task of redirecting my rbind.io domain to my custom domain silviacanelon.com.\n\n\n\nindex.qmd\n\nmanual_redirects &lt;-\n  readr::read_table(here::here(\"static\", \"_manualredirects.txt\"),\n                    col_names = FALSE) |&gt; \n  dplyr::mutate(redirect = paste0(X1, \" \", X2, \" \", X3))\n\nmanual_redirects &lt;- manual_redirects$redirect\n\nhead(manual_redirects)\n\n\n[1] \"https://silvia.rbind.io/authors/silvia/avatar.png https://silviacanelon.com/about/sidebar/avatar.png 301!\"\n[2] \"https://silvia.rbind.io/post/* https://silviacanelon.com/blog/:splat 301!\"                                \n[3] \"https://silvia.rbind.io/blog/* https://silviacanelon.com/blog/:splat 301!\"                                \n[4] \"https://silvia.rbind.io/talk/* https://silviacanelon.com/talk/:splat 301!\"                                \n[5] \"https://silvia.rbind.io/project/* https://silviacanelon.com/project/:splat 301!\"                          \n[6] \"http://silvia.rbind.io/* https://silviacanelon.com/:splat 301!\"                                           \n\n\nListing subdirectories\nThe next step defines a function that obtains a list of subdirectories, iterates it over the four groups of posts in my site (blog posts, talks, publications, and projects), and compiles the files into a data frame.\n\n\n\nindex.qmd\n\n# function: obtain list of post paths\nlist_paths &lt;- function(folder) {\n  posts &lt;-\n    list.dirs(\n    path = c(here::here(folder)),\n    full.names = FALSE,\n    recursive = FALSE\n    ) |&gt; \n    tibble::as_tibble_col(column_name = \"path\")  |&gt;\n    dplyr::mutate(folder = folder)\n}\n\n# define post folders\nfolders &lt;- c(\"blog\", \"project\", \"publication\", \"talk\")\n\n# list post paths by folder\nposts &lt;- purrr::map(folders, list_paths) |&gt; purrr::list_rbind()\n\nhead(posts)\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nDefining redirects\nThis next chunk removes the month and day from year-month-day-slug so that I’m left with shorter paths with the format year-slug, and uses these paths and the folders they are housed in to create redirects.\nThe resulting redirects will point the short year-slug link to this blog post:\nhttps://silviacanelon.com/blog/2023-hello-quarto\nTo the longer year-month-day-slug Quarto link to this post:\nhttps://silviacanelon.com/blog/2023-09-29-hello-quarto\n\n# extract short paths and create redirects\nposts &lt;- \n  posts |&gt; \n  dplyr::mutate(\n    # extract the year-slugs\n    short_path = stringr::str_remove(path, \"(?!\\\\d{4}-)\\\\d{2}-\\\\d{2}-(?!\\\\d)\"),\n    # create short paths\n    short_path = paste0(folder, \"/\", short_path),\n    # create lines to insert to a netlify _redirect file\n    redirects = paste0(\"/\", short_path, \" \", \"/\", folder, \"/\", path)\n    )\n\nhead(posts)\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nWriting redirects file\nThe last step takes the redirects from the data frame produced in the previous step, combines them with the manual redirects, and writes them to a new text file _redirects. This file is written into the _site folder where my Quarto site is rendered, and where Netlify will know to find it.\n\n\n\nindex.qmd\n\n# extract redirects\nredirects &lt;- posts$redirects\n\n# combine with manual redirects\nredirects_combined &lt;- c(manual_redirects, redirects)\n\n# write the _redirect file\nwriteLines(redirects_combined, here::here(\"_site\", \"_redirects\"))"

    "text": "With Alison Hill’s Up and Running with Blogdown post! Super helpful, though because I came to it 2.5 years late, it was more like ‘up and running with lots of water breaks’ because I had to stop and account for changes made to the Hugo Academic theme in the meantime.\n\nFor example, prior to Academic version 4.6, custom CSS was added using the plugins_css option in params.toml, but in current version 4.8, the theme supports SCSS (a superset of CSS) and a custom.scss file is added in the assets/scss/ folder.\n\nThe going futher section in Alison’s post specifically talks about customizing the out-of-the-box theme and Alison directly links to her custom CSS file, which I closely referred to when changing colors in my custom SCSS file.\nAlison’s CSS helped me customize everything from text colors and fonts to alert colors and borders for Academic’s light mode. At this point I had the light mode looking the way I wanted but the dark mode still used out-of-the-box colors for the most part and they just didn’t go.\n\nSo I decided not to enable the dark-mode option in params.toml until I could figure out how to customize my stylesheet accordingly. That time has come because it turns out it’s pretty straightforward!\nThe Blogdown book does an excellent job summarizing what you need to know about CSS. This post builds on that a little by incorporating features made possible by SCSS including variables."

The recommended color is #121212\nAs you layer components, surfaces with a higher elevation (closer to the hypothetical ‘light source’) should be lighter than those below it to create a visual hierarchy. This can be achieved by applying a semi-transparent white overlay to the primary dark gray surface.\n\n\n\nThe primary text color for dark themes should not be 100% opaque white (i.e. #FFFFFF) because it can appear to bleed or blur against dark backgrounds and be difficult to read.\nText hierarchy is established by controlling the opacity, for example:\n\nHigh emphasis text is white with 87% opacity:rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.87)\nMedium emphasis is white with 60% opacity:rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.60)\nDisabled text is white with 38% opacity:rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.38)\n\nTo meet WCAG AA standard, there must be a 4.5:1 contrast level between the body text and the dark theme surface at the highest/lightest elevation. The contrast level is 7:1 for the WCAG AAA standard."

    "section": "Cards",
    "text": "Cards\nThe first step is to extract information about the Trello cards themselves. This information is contained within a list of data frames and requires flattening which makes the nested hierarchical data structure into a flatter structure by assigning each of the nested variables its own column as much as possible. Then, the most important variables are selected as cards_trim before moving on to extracting label information.\n# selecting cards information\ncards &lt;- trello$cards # list of 1\n\n# flattening\ncards_flat &lt;- flatten(cards) #list of 37\n\n# tibble time\ncards_flat_tbl &lt;- as_tibble(cards_flat) # 32 obs of 37 variables\nglimpse(cards_flat_tbl)\n\n# selecting wanted variables\ncards_trim &lt;- cards_flat_tbl %&gt;%\n  select(id, idShort, idList, dateLastActivity, name, desc, dueComplete, due,\n         labels, attachments, shortUrl, closed) %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(dateLastActivity))\n\nLabels\nRelevant information about the labels is selected and the unnest function is used to flatten because labels is a list of data frames. Again, I found Kan’s post helpful here! Particularly for saving the label details as a character list, which is helpful later on. Once we get to Airtable it’ll be important that label information for each card be structured as a simple list of words (i.e. label1, label2, label3). We get close once the labels are contained within a character list labelList, but there are still “c”s and parentheses that need to be removed. String manipulation is something I’m still learning about so the code below is far from elegant!\n# extracting labels details\nlabels_info &lt;- cards_trim %&gt;%\n  select(id, idShort, labels) %&gt;%\n  unnest() %&gt;% # no arguments because the nested items don't have names\n  rename(labelName = name) %&gt;%\n  select(id, idShort, labelName) %&gt;%\n  group_by(id, idShort) %&gt;%\n  summarize(labelList = list(labelName)) %&gt;%\n  mutate(labelList = as.character(labelList)) %&gt;%\n  mutate(labelList_tidy = str_remove_all(labelList, pattern = \"\\\"\")) %&gt;%\n  mutate(labelList_tidy = str_remove_all(labelList_tidy, pattern =\"c\\\\(\")) %&gt;%\n  mutate(labelList_tidy = str_remove_all(labelList_tidy, pattern =\"\\\\)\")) %&gt;%\n  unique()\n\nknitr::kable(labels_info %&gt;% head(n = 3L))\n\n# joining back with main cards data frame\nct_labels &lt;- left_join(cards_trim %&gt;% select(-labels), labels_info %&gt;% select(-labelList))\n\n\nAttachments\nThe next step is to download all of the items attached to the cards onto a local folder. I found this StackOverflow post really helpful. When I tried this out on my own Trello board I also found that I couldn’t download the few attachments I had made from my local drive. This StackOverflow post helped me figure out how to flag and catch these download errors so that I could create a list of the urls with “attachment errors” that I could follow up with manually.\n# expanding the attachment lists into separate url records\natt_urls &lt;- ct_labels %&gt;%\n  select(idShort, attachments) %&gt;%\n  unnest() %&gt;%\n  select(idShort, url) %&gt;%\n  mutate(url = as.character(url),\n         attachmentError = 'FALSE')\nknitr::kable(att_urls %&gt;% head(n = 3L))\n\n# creating directory for attachments\ndirAttachments &lt;- \"attachments/\"\ndir.create(dirAttachments)\n\n# downloading urls and checking for errors using try()\nfor (i in 1:length(att_urls$url)){\n  locAttachments &lt;-\n        paste(dirAttachments, \"/\", att_urls$idShort[i], \"_\", basename(att_urls$url[i]), sep = \"\")\n  step_to_try &lt;- try(attachment_check &lt;- download.file(att_urls$url[i], destfile = locAttachments))\n  if(\"try-error\" %in% class(step_to_try)) {\n    cat(\"Error row: \", i, \"\\n\", \"Error message: \", step_to_try[1], sep = \"\")\n    att_urls$attachmentError[i] = 'TRUE'\n  }\n}\nThe following selects the attachment records with errors, renames somes variables, and exports the data frame as a CSV.\n# preparing data frame for export to CSV\nattachment_errors &lt;- att_urls %&gt;%\n  filter(attachmentError == TRUE) %&gt;%\n  rename(Task_Id = idShort, Attachment_URL = url, Attachment_Error = attachmentError)\n\n# exporting to CSV\nwrite.csv(attachment_errors, file = \"attachment_errors.csv\")\n\nAside: If you have a lot of attachments per card, you may want to create a directory folder for each card. This for loop will get you there – use it instead of the one above:\n\n# creates individual directory folders for each card id\nfor (i in 1:length(att_urls$url)){\n  dirAttachments &lt;- paste(dirFiles, \"attachments\", att_urls$idShort[i], sep = \"/\")\n  dir.create(dirAttachments) # creates directory for each unique card id\n  locAttachments &lt;- paste(dirAttachments, basename(url[i]), sep = \"/\")\n  download.file(url[i], destfile = locAttachments)\n}\nRecords in the main cards data frame are labeled “TRUE” within the attachments column if they have attachments and “FALSE” if they don’t.\n# converts the attachment column to a categorical variable in the main cards+labels data frame\nct_labels &lt;- ct_labels %&gt;%\n  mutate(attachments = ifelse(idShort %in% att_urls$idShort, TRUE, FALSE))"

    "text": "General resources\n\nNote: There is an extensive list of data viz accessibility resources at https://github.com/dataviza11y/resources/blob/main/README.md\nArticle by Doug Schepers that provides great background on data viz accessibility, explains how data visualization itself is assistive technology, and offers considerations for a variety of readers: Why Accessibility Is at the Heart of Data Visualization\nThe Chartability methodology helps data viz practitioners audit their data viz, and it’s language/tool-agnostic. Chartability was created by Frank Elavsky with input from the broader community and is the most thorough set of standards I’ve come across.\n\nØystein Moseng provides some basic practices to consider in the post 10 Guidelines for DataViz Accessibility. Among those included are these two which I don’t see covered as often:\n\nDo not rely on color alone to convey information. I’ve also heard this referred to as “color independence” and in some cases as “dual-encoding” of information\n\nPrefer simple, familiar visualizations over complex novelties.\n\n\n\n\n\nPie chart from Øystein’s post using color and (optional) patterns to encode information\n\n\n\n\nTalk at the Data Visualization Society’s Outlier conference earlier this year, by Frank Elavsky, Larene Le Gassick, and Sarah Fossheim: Are your visualizations excluding people?\n\nGuidelines by Amy Cesal on how to write alt text for data visualizations: Writing Alt Text for Data Visualization\n\n\n\n\n\nExample template from Amy’s post\n\n\n\nPost by Lisa Charlotte Muth on how to pick colors for your data viz that everyone can appreciate: How to pick more beautiful colors for your data visualizations - Datawrapper Blog\n\n\n\n\n\nExample from Charlotte’s post of two different approaches to improving a pie chart\n\n\n\nPost by Gareth Ford Williams from The Readability Group about how to make more informed font choices: A Guide to Understanding What Makes a Typeface Accessible\n\n\nRelated is a talk from The Readability Group sharing findings from a survey study about font preferences including 2000+ participants. Among these were participants with dyslexia characteristics and participants with poor near vision: Don’t Believe the Type!\n\n\n\n\n\nBar graph showing the frequency by which 20 different fonts were selected by study participants with strong poor near vision in comparison with users with no poor near vision.\n\n\n\n\n\nSarah Fossheim authored a post titled An intro to designing accessible data visualizations which uses real-word applications to demonstrate 10 different accessibility practices.\nSarah also provides a code-through showing how to make screenreader-friendly graphs using D3.js in their post How to create a screen reader accessible graph like Apple’s with D3.js\n\n\n\nAmber Thomas provides an example of how to make scrollytales more accessible in a piece created with Ofunne Amaka for The Pudding: The Naked Truth\n\n\n\nI'm excited to release this project for many reasons, but one among them is that I introduced lots of new (to me) #a11y features.

After web-scraping alt text from TidyTuesday tweets we found that only 3% of data viz tweets had alt text to accompany them (over the first 3 years of the TidyTuesday project). Links to the video recording, slides, and resources at https://github.com/spcanelon/csvConf2021. The talk includes guidelines on what makes effective alt text for data viz (complementary to those Amy Cesal includes in her post).\n\n\n\n\n\nSlide from our presentation summarizing the most useful alt-text features found among 196 data viz tweets\n\n\n\nPost from RStudio on how to add alt text to visualizations produced in R Markdown using code chunk option fig.alt: New in knitr: Improved accessibility with image alt text. New in knitr v1.35: You can now add code chunk options inside the code chunk!\nExample updated thanks to a heads-up from Garrick:\n#| fig.cap: Bigger flippers, bigger bills \n#| fig.alt: Scatterplot of flipper length by bill length of 3 penguin species, where we show penguins with bigger flippers have bigger bills.\n\nggplot(data = penguins, aes(x = flipper_length_mm,\n                            y = bill_length_mm,\n                            color = species)) +\n  geom_point(aes(shape = species), alpha = 0.8) +\n  scale_color_manual(\n    values = c(\"darkorange\",\"purple\",\"cyan4\")) \n\n\nCode chunk adapted from the RStudio blog post\n\nThe previous example included fig.cap and fig.alt in the code chunk heading:\n\n\n\n\nBigger flippers, bigger bills\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ggpattern R package developed by Mike FC supports filling ggplot2 geometries with patterns. If used judiciously, patterns can help make visualizations more accessible by providing an additional way to encode information without relying on color. Below is one example using ggpattern v0.2.2:\n\nlibrary(ggpattern)\n\npenguinColors &lt;- c(\"darkorange\", \"purple\", \"cyan4\")\n\nggplot(penguins, aes(species)) +\ngeom_bar_pattern(aes(fill = species,\n                    pattern = species,\n                    pattern_color = species),\n  fill = penguinColors,\n  alpha = 0.1,\n  linewidth = 1,\n  color = penguinColors,\n  pattern_color = penguinColors,\n  pattern_fill = penguinColors,\n  pattern_spacing = 0.025\n) +\ntheme_minimal() +\ntheme(legend.position = 'none')\n\n\n\nDifferent patterns mapped onto penguin species along with different colors\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Highcharter R package developed by Joshua Kunst adds interactivity to data viz using Highcharts JavaScript components designed with web accessibility in mind. The package has a learning curve, but lucky for us Mara Averick wrote an excellent series of blog posts on using the Highcharts accessibility module with {highcharter}.\n\n\n\n\n\nInteractive scatterplot from Mara’s post using color and shape to encode information about penguin species"

The cost conversion was done according to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) adjusted by Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) provided by the World Bank. We wanted conference attendees and sponsors from different parts of the world to be able to participate in useR! and believed that this is a fair approach. It reflects the reality that attendees and sponsors from “High income” countries have a different purchasing power than those from “Low income” countries. The income categories and cost conversions are listed in a data table created in R that attendees can use to search for their country and attendee status if applicable (i.e. Industry, Academia, Student). They can use a built-in search bar, or filter according to a specific column.\nYou can read more about purchasing power parities, price level indexes, and PPP-based expenditures in the May 2020 World Bank post New results from the International Comparison Program shed light on the size of the global economy.\nThe Global Income Groups listed in the fee tables below were obtained using data from the 2017 International Comparison Program (ICP) which you can read more about in the report Purchasing Power Parities and the Size of World Economies: Results from the 2017 International Comparison Program. The conversion factors were calculated using PPP-based GDP per capita for each Global Income Group using data from the ICP 2017 World Bank Database.\n\n\n\n Back to topCitationFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nCanelón, Silvia. 2021. “useR!2021 Cost Conversion Tool.”\nJanuary 1, 2021. https://silviacanelon.com/project/2021-01-01-useR-2021/."

Our study describes a cohort of TBI patients within the Penn Medicine health system and the distribution of TBI injury mechanisms and severity.\n\n\nMethods\nWe obtained Electronic Health Record data for 1,060,100 female patients treated at Penn Medicine inpatient or outpatient clinics from 2010-2017. We identified patients with TBI diagnoses using ICD-9/10 codes and the Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Department of Defense (DOD) definitions for TBI and TBI severity. The CDC/DOD codes for TBI were then manually annotated with mechanisms of TBI injury (e.g. Sport Mechanism of Injury, Collision or Crash, Foreign Body Object). The highest TBI severity category was noted for each patient and defined, in increasing severity, as “Mild,” “Moderate,” “Severe,” or “Penetrating.” We report the distribution of TBI mechanisms and severity among this patient population.\n\n\nResults\nThere were 4,392 patients with a total of 9,800 TBI diagnoses. The majority of diagnoses in the cohort were Mild (5,704; 58%), followed by Moderate (3,840; 39%), Severe (173; 1.8%), and Penetrating (83; 0.8%). The following are the six most common mechanisms observed to contribute to TBI diagnoses: “Injury,” “Mechanism of Injury,” “Accidents,” “Physical Accidents,” “Fall Mechanism of Injury,” and “Traffic Vehicle Accident.”"

    "text": "Part II. Orthographic map\n\n\nA while back I saw Chris Campbell’s global maps from the Financial Times like in this Tweet and I thought I needed to do it in R. In this first post of 2023 we’ll see how we can access the GFS (Global Forecast System) data and visualize it with {ggplot2}, even though there are several ways, in this case we use the Google Earth Engine API via the {rgee} package for accessing the GFS data. We will select the most recent run and calculate the maximum temperature for the next few days.\n\nPackages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPackage\nDescription\n\n\n\n\ntidyverse\nCollection of packages (visualization, manipulation): ggplot2, dplyr, purrr, etc.\n\n\nlubridate\nEasy manipulation of dates and times\n\n\nsf\nSimple Feature: import, export and manipulate vector data\n\n\nterra\nImport, export and manipulate raster ({raster} successor package)\n\n\nrgee\nAccess to Google Earth Engine API\n\n\ngiscoR\nAdministrative boundaries of the world\n\n\nggshadow\nExtension to ggplot2 for shaded and glow geometries\n\n\nfs\nProvides a cross-platform, uniform interface to file system operations\n\n\nggforce\nProvides missing functionality to ggplot2\n\n\n\n\n#  install the packages if necessary\nif(!require(\"tidyverse\")) install.packages(\"tidyverse\")\nif(!require(\"sf\")) install.packages(\"sf\")\nif(!require(\"terra\")) install.packages(\"terra\")\nif(!require(\"fs\")) install.packages(\"fs\")\nif(!require(\"rgee\")) install.packages(\"rgee\")\nif(!require(\"giscoR\")) install.packages(\"giscoR\")\n1if(!require(\"ggshadow\")) install.packages(\"ggshadow\")\nif(!require(\"ggforce\")) install.packages(\"ggforce\")\nif(!require(\"googledrive\")) install.packages(\"googledrive\")\n\n#  packages\nlibrary(rgee)\nlibrary(terra)\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(giscoR)\n\nlibrary(fs)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(lubridate)\nlibrary(ggshadow)\nlibrary(ggforce)\nlibrary(googledrive)\n\n\n1\n\nToday the newest version 0.0.5 is not working correctly. Here I used the 0.0.4 version.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart I. Geoprocessing with Google Earth Engine (GEE)\n\nBefore using GEE in R\nThe first step is to sign up at earthengine.google.com. In addition, it is necessary to install CLI of gcloud (https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install?hl=es-419), you just have to follow the instructions in Google. Regarding the GEE language, many functions that are applied are similar to what is known from {tidyverse}. More help can be found at https://r-spatial.github.io/rgee/reference/rgee-package.html and on the GEE page itself.\nThe most essential of GEE’s native Javascript language is that it is characterized by the way of combining functions and variables using the dot, which is replaced by the $ in R. All GEE functions start with the prefix ee_* (ee_print( ), ee_image_to_drive()).\nOnce we have gcloud and the {rgee} package installed we can proceed to create the Python virtual environment. The ee_install() function takes care of installing Anaconda 3 and all necessary packages. To check the correct installation of Python, and particularly of the numpy and earthengine-api packages, we can use ee_check().\n\nee_install() # create python virtual environment\nee_check() # check if everything is correct\n\nBefore programming with GEE’s own syntax, GEE must be authenticated and initialized using the ee_Initialize() function. Not working! See issue https://github.com/r-spatial/rgee/issues/355\n\nee_Initialize(drive = TRUE) \n\nInstead you should do:\n\nee$Authenticate(auth_mode='notebook')\n\n\nee$Initialize(project='ee-dominicroye')\n\n\n\nAccess the Global Forecast System\nA time series of images or multidimensional data is called an ImageCollection in GEE. Each dataset is assigned an ID and we can access it by making the following call ee$ImageCollection('ID_IMAGECOLLECTION'). There are helper functions that allow conversion of purely R classes to Javascript, e.g. for dates rdate_to_eedate(). The first thing we do is to filter to the most recent date with the last run of the GFS model.\nWe have to know that, unlike R, only when GEE tasks are sent, the calculation are executed on the servers using all the created GEE objects. Most steps create only EarthEngine objects what you will see soon in this post.\n\n## GFS forecast\ndataset &lt;- ee$ImageCollection('NOAA/GFS0P25')$filter(ee$Filter$date(rdate_to_eedate(today()-days(1)),\n\nrdate_to_eedate(today()+days(1))))\ndataset\n\nThe model runs every 6 hours (0, 6, 12, 18), so the ee_get_date_ic() function extracts the dates to choose the most recent one. This is the first time that calculations are run.\n\n# vector of unique run dates\nlast_run &lt;- ee_get_date_ic(dataset)$time_start |&gt; unique()\nlast_run\n\n\n# select the last one\nlast_run &lt;- max(last_run)\n\nNext we filter the date of the last run and select the band of the air temperature at 2m. Forecast dates are attributes of each model run up to 336 hours (14 days) from the day of execution. When we want to make changes to each image in an ImageCollection we must make use of the map() function, similar to the one we know from the {purrr} package. In this case we redefine the date of each image (system:time_start: run date) by that of the forecast (forecast_time). It is important that the R function to apply is inside ee_utils_pyfunc(), which translates it into Python. Then we extract the dates from the 14 day forecast.\n\n# last run and variable selection\ntemp &lt;- dataset$filter(ee$Filter$date(rdate_to_eedate(last_run)))$select('temperature_2m_above_ground')\n\n# define the forecast dates for each hour\nforcast_time &lt;- temp$map(ee_utils_pyfunc(function(img)  {\n  \n  return(ee$Image(img)$set('system:time_start',ee$Image(img)$get(\"forecast_time\")))\n\n  })\n)\n\n# get the forecast dates\ndate_forcast &lt;- ee_get_date_ic(forcast_time)\nhead(date_forcast)\n\nHere we could export the hourly temperature data, but it would also be possible to estimate the maximum or minimum daily temperature for the next 14 days. To achieve this we define the beginning and end of the period, and calculate the number of days. What we do in simple terms is map over the number of days to filter on each day and apply the max() function or any other similar function.\n\n# define start end of the period\nendDate &lt;- rdate_to_eedate(round_date(max(date_forcast$time_start)-days(1), \"day\"))\nstartDate &lt;- rdate_to_eedate(round_date(min(date_forcast$time_start), \"day\"))\n\n# number of days\nnumberOfDays &lt;- endDate$difference(startDate, 'days')\n\n# calculate the daily maximum\ndaily &lt;- ee$ImageCollection(\n  ee$List$sequence(0, numberOfDays$subtract(1))$\n  map(ee_utils_pyfunc(function (dayOffset) {\n    start = startDate$advance(dayOffset, 'days')\n    end = start$advance(1, 'days')\n    return(forcast_time$\n    filterDate(start, end)$\n    max()$ # alternativa: min(), mean()\n    set('system:time_start', start$millis()))\n  }))\n)\n\n# dates of the daily maximum\nhead(ee_get_date_ic(daily))\n\n\n\nDynamic map via GEE\nSince there is the possibility of adding images to a dynamic map in the GEE code editor, we can also do it from R using the GEE function Map.addLayer(). We simply select the first day with first(). In the other argument we define the range of the temperature values and the color ramp.\n\nMap$addLayer(\n        eeObject = daily$first(),\n        visParams = list(min = -45, max = 45,\n                        palette = rev(RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(11, \"RdBu\"))),\n        name = \"GFS\") + \nMap$addLegend(\n  list(min = -45, max = 45, \n        palette = rev(RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(11, \"RdBu\"))), \n        name = \"Maximum temperature\", \n        position = \"bottomright\", \n        bins = 10)\n\n\n\nExport multiple images\nThe {rgee} package has a very useful function for exporting an ImageCollection: ee_imagecollection_to_local(). Before using it, we need to set a region, the one that is intended to be exported. In this case, we export the entire globe with a rectangle covering the whole Earth.\n\n# earth extension\ngeom &lt;- ee$Geometry$Polygon(coords = list(\n  c(-180, -90), \n  c(180, -90),\n  c(180, 90),\n  c(-180, 90),\n  c(-180, -90)\n),\nproj = \"EPSG:4326\",\ngeodesic = FALSE)\n\ngeom # EarthEngine object of type geometry\n\n# temporary download folder\n\ndata_export &lt;- daily$filter(ee$Filter$date(rdate_to_eedate(today()), rdate_to_eedate(today()+days(3))))\n\n# Obtener la lista de imágenes\nimage_list &lt;- data_export$toList(data_export$size())\n\n# Función para exportar cada imagen\nexport_image &lt;- function(image, index) {\n  image &lt;- ee$Image(image_list$get(index))\n  task &lt;- ee$batch$Export$image$toDrive(\n    image = image$clip(geom),\n    description = paste0(\"Image_\", index),\n    scale = 20000,\n    region = geom,\n    folder = \"tomorrow\", # create folder on your drive before submitting\n    maxPixels = 1e13\n  )\n  task$start()\n}\n\n# Iterar sobre la lista de imágenes y exportarlas\nfor (i in 0:(data_export$size()$getInfo() - 1)) {\n  export_image(image_list, i)\n}\n\nee_monitoring(eeTaskList = TRUE)\n\n\ngee_files &lt;- drive_ls(path = \"tomorrow\") \n\n\nwalk(gee_files$id, drive_download, overwrite = T)\n\n\n\n\nPart II. Orthographic map\n\nData\nOf course, the first step is to import the data with the help of rast(). We also define the name of each layer according to its temporal dimension correctly.\n\n# paths to downloaded data\nforecast_world &lt;- dir_ls(regexp = \"tif\")\n\n# guarantee the file order \nfile_ord &lt;- str_extract(forecast_world, \"_[0-9]{1,2}\") |&gt; parse_number()\n\nforecast_rast &lt;- rast(forecast_world[order(file_ord)]) # import\nforecast_rast\n\n# define the temporal dimension as the name of each layer\nnames(forecast_rast) &lt;- seq(today(), today() + days(2), \"day\")\ntime(forecast_rast) &lt;- seq(today(), today() + days(2), \"day\")\nforecast_rast\n\n# plot\nplot(forecast_rast)\n\nNow we can define the orthographic projection indicating with +lat_0 and +lon_0 the center of the projection. We then reproject and convert the raster to a data.frame.\n\n# projection definition\northo_crs &lt;-'+proj=ortho +lat_0=51 +lon_0=0.5 +x_0=0 +y_0=0 +R=6371000 +units=m +no_defs +type=crs'\n\n# reproject the raster\nras_ortho &lt;- project(forecast_rast, ortho_crs)\n\n# convert the raster to a data.frame of xyz\nforecast_df &lt;- as.data.frame(ras_ortho, xy = TRUE)\n\n# transform to a long format\nforecast_df &lt;- pivot_longer(forecast_df, 3:length(forecast_df), names_to = \"date\", values_to = \"ta\")\n\n\n\nAdministrative boundaries and graticules\nWe import the administrative boundaries with gisco_get_countries() which we need prepare for the orthographic projection. In the same way we create the graticule using st_graticule(). In order to preserve the geometry, it will be necessary to cut to only the visible part. The ocean is created starting from a point at 0.0 with the radius of the earth. Using the st_intersection() function we reduce to the visible part and reproject the boundaries.\n\n# obtain the administrative limits\nworld_poly &lt;- gisco_get_countries(year = \"2016\", epsg = \"4326\", resolution = \"10\") \n\n# get the global graticule\ngrid &lt;- st_graticule()\n\n# define what would be ocean\nocean &lt;- st_point(x = c(0,0)) |&gt;\n            st_buffer(dist = 6371000) |&gt; # earth radius\n              st_sfc(crs = ortho_crs)\nplot(ocean)\n\n\n# select only visible from the boundaries and reproject\nworld &lt;- world_poly |&gt;\n            st_intersection(st_transform(ocean, 4326)) |&gt;\n            st_transform(crs = ortho_crs) # \nplot(world)\n\nFor the graticules we must repeat the same selection, although we previously limit the grid of lines to the ocean.

    "text": "I recently came across a map from the National Atlas of Spain showing the number of libraries by municipality. However, one thing directly caught my attention. There’s a saying that many maps show only the population, and this seems to be the case here. The map does not provide any remarkable information about the distribution of libraries; it merely shows where the most people live. It’s a very common pitfall. There are many phenomena that depend on population. It can be assumed that the number of libraries largely depends on the number of inhabitants in each municipality. Therefore, we see cities like Madrid, Barcelona, Seville, Valencia, and many provincial capitals with a higher number of libraries.\nNormalization of population-dependent variables can be performed in different ways, depending on the context and type of data. In our case, it involves dividing the number of libraries by the total population. To avoid very small numbers, it is common to multiply by a fixed population, such as 10,000. Another alternative, but not in this case, would be the use of percent.\n\\[  \n\\text{Libraries per 10,000 inhabitants} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Number of libraries}}{\\text{Total population}}\\right) \\times 10,000\n\\]\nIf you divide the other way around, it gives you a different perspective. You are calculating how many people, on average, have access to a single library.\n\\[  \n\\text{Inhabitants per library} = \\frac{\\text{Total population}}{\\text{Number of libraries}}\n\\]\nLet’s get to work!"

Big cities, such as Madrid, Barcelona or Valencia, are highlighted.\nBut what would we see if we normalize the variable?\nTo do this, we must first join the population data and calculate the rate.\n\nm2 &lt;- st_centroid(mun) |&gt;\n  left_join(pob_mun) |&gt;\n  mutate(norm_pob = n * 10000 / total) |&gt;\n  arrange(-norm_pob)\n\nselect(m2, n, total:norm_pob)\n\nNow we simply repeat the same map using the norm_pob column.\n\np2 &lt;- ggplot() +\n  geom_sf(data = ccaa, fill = \"grey90\", colour = \"white\") +\n  geom_sf(\n    data = m2,\n    aes(size = norm_pob),\n    alpha = .5, shape = 21, fill = \"#7a0177\", colour = \"white\"\n  ) +\n  scale_size(range = c(.5, 10), breaks = c(1, 10, 100, 500)) +\n  labs(size = NULL, title = \"Libraries per 10,000 inhabitants\") +\n  theme_void()\np2\n\n\nThis map now tells a completely different story. We see a high number of libraries per inhabitant in certain regions, while others are more homogeneous with a consistently low number of libraries. However, there are also impossible values that stand out. For example, in the north, Roncesvalles reaches 526 libraries per 10,000 inhabitants! That can’t be right, can it? This issue is caused by the very small municipalities. In this case, there is one library for every 19 inhabitants. In any case, what is also noticeable is that there are significantly fewer libraries per inhabitant in major cities like Madrid and Barcelona, with only 1 library per 10,000 inhabitants. It is not easy to find a multiplier that works uniformly to reflect both small and large municipalities.\nTo solve the problem of small municipalities, one possible good strategy would be to exclude all those with less than 100 inhabitants. It can even help in reducing overlapping.\n\np3 &lt;- ggplot() +\n  geom_sf(data = ccaa, fill = \"grey90\", colour = \"white\") +\n  geom_sf(\n    data = filter(m2, total &gt; 100),\n    aes(size = norm_pob),\n    alpha = .5, shape = 21, fill = \"#7a0177\", colour = \"white\"\n  ) +\n  scale_size(range = c(.1, 10), breaks = c(1, 10, 50, 90)) +\n  labs(size = NULL, title = \"Libraries per 10,000 inhabitants (without municipalities &lt; 100)\") +\n  theme_void()\n\np3\n\n\nFinally, we create a comparison with the patchwork grammar.\n\np1 + p2 + p3 & theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 20, hjust = .5),\n                    legend.text = element_text(size = 12))\n\n\nDifferent ways of telling different stories! A completely different question is how much the overlapping of circles prevents us from reading the map accurately. For instance, we could use a Dorling cartogram for the population and use color to show the number of libraries. Below, you see an example with the foreign population by origin. The R Code for this I will post another time."

The problem I faced was that it is designed for only one category or level, however, as we can see we have up to three levels of severity. If we use the function for low severity we get the following result.\n\n# Dorling low gravity map\ndor &lt;- cartogram_dorling(filter(ehf, levels == \"low\"), \"n\", k = .3)\n\n# map\nggplot(\n  dor,\n  aes(fill = n)\n) +\n  geom_sf(\n    data = esp,\n    fill = \"grey80\",\n    colour = \"white\",\n    linewidth = .3\n  ) +\n  geom_sf() +\n  scale_fill_distiller(palette = \"YlOrRd\", direction = 1) +\n  labs(fill = NULL, title = \"Number of heat weave days with low severity\") +\n  theme_void() +\n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"top\",\n    legend.key.height = unit(.5, \"lines\"),\n    legend.key.width = unit(3, \"lines\"),\n    plot.title = element_text(margin = margin(t = 5, b = 10), hjust = .5)\n  )\n\n\nSo, what can we do? We should take a closer look at the function, which facilitates the creation of the Dorling map (link). First we could create a map of small multiples, but one problem we encounter is that we cannot set a maximum value of a variable.

I also considered making a proportional symbol map with circles in the same location, using color mixing and transparency in the style of this map (link). Finally I decided to modify the function to achieve a grouped position with circle packing. I introduced another argument surf = null for the extension of the data set, also kept the change of introducing the possibility of the maximum value with the same aim, and I changed the circleRepelLayout() function to the circleProgressiveLayout() one. The second one arranges a set of circles, denoted by their sizes, placing consecutively each circle externally tangent to two previously placed circles avoiding overlaps. Unlike the original layout in which the circles are ordered by iterative pairwise repulsion within a bounding rectangle. Another potential alternative could be the use of networks or graphs with {ggraph}, but I have not yet gotten around to testing it.\n\npackedcircle_dodge_position.sf &lt;- function(x,\n                                            weight,\n                                            surf = NULL,\n                                            limit_mx = NULL, # new argument\n                                            k = .5) {\n  # proj or unproj\n  if (sf::st_is_longlat(x)) {\n    stop('Using an unprojected map.

However, these vector boundaries with displacement cannot be used in all assumptions, as this is a false geographical position and is not suitable for spatial calculations or other projections.\nWe obtain the vector boundaries using the esp_get_prov() function for the provincial level with the projection code EPSG:4326 (WGS84).

We see a high number of libraries per inhabitant in certain regions, while others are more homogeneous with a consistently low number of libraries. However, there are also impossible values that stand out. For example, in the north, Roncesvalles reaches 526 libraries per 10,000 inhabitants! That can’t be right, can it? This issue is caused by the very small municipalities. In this case, there is one library for every 19 inhabitants. In any case, what is also noticeable is that there are significantly fewer libraries per inhabitant in major cities like Madrid and Barcelona, with only 1 library per 10,000 inhabitants. It is not easy to find a multiplier that works uniformly to reflect both small and large municipalities.\nTo solve the problem of small municipalities, one possible good strategy would be to exclude all those with less than 100 inhabitants. It can even help in reducing overlapping.\n\np3 &lt;- ggplot() +\n  geom_sf(data = ccaa, fill = \"grey90\", colour = \"white\") +\n  geom_sf(\n    data = filter(m2, total &gt; 100),\n    aes(size = norm_pob),\n    alpha = .5, shape = 21, fill = \"#7a0177\", colour = \"white\"\n  ) +\n  scale_size(range = c(.1, 10), breaks = c(1, 10, 50, 90)) +\n  labs(size = NULL, title = \"Libraries per 10,000 inhabitants (without municipalities &lt; 100)\") +\n  theme_void()\n\np3\n\n\nFinally, we create a comparison with the patchwork grammar.\n\np1 + p2 + p3 & theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 20, hjust = .5),\n                    legend.text = element_text(size = 12))\n\n\nDifferent ways of telling different stories! A completely different question is how much the overlapping of circles prevents us from reading the map accurately. For instance, we could use a Dorling cartogram for the population and use color to show the number of libraries. Below, you see an example with the foreign population by origin. The R Code for this I will post another time."

Except for lake boundaries download, the necessary data is obtained through APIs using different packages. For example, the giscoR package allows you to get country boundaries with different resolutions.\n\nsuiz &lt;- gisco_get_countries(country = \"Switzerland\", resolution = \"03\")\n\nplot(suiz)\n\n\nThe lake boundaries correspond to a layer of digital cartographic models (DKM500) provided by swisstopo. The objective is to keep only the largest lakes; therefore, we exclude all those with less than 50 km2 and also those located entirely in Italian territory. Remember that with the units package, we can indicate units and thus do calculations.\n\n# import the lakes boundaries\nsuiz_lakes &lt;- st_read(\"22_DKM500_GEWAESSER_PLY.shp\")\n\n# filter the largest ones\nsuiz_lakes &lt;- mutate(suiz_lakes, areakm = set_units(SHP_AREA, \"m2\") |&gt;\n  set_units(\"km2\")) |&gt;\n  filter(\n    areakm &gt; set_units(50, \"km2\"),\n    !NAMN1 %in% c(\n      \"Lago di Como / Lario\",\n      \"Lago d'Iseo\",\n      \"Lago di Garda\"\n    )\n  )\n\nplot(suiz_lakes)\n\n\nDigital Elevation Model (DEM)\nThe get_elev_raster() function allows us to download a DEM from any region of the world through different providers in raster format. By default, it uses AWS. An essential argument is the latitude-dependent resolution, which can be specified as the zoom level (see function help). For example, we use level 10, which at a latitude of 45º would correspond to approximately 100 m.\nAfter obtaining the DEM from Switzerland, we must mask the country’s boundaries. The object’s class is RasterLayer from the raster package, however, the new standard is terra with the class SpatRaster. That’s why we convert it and then apply the mask. Finally, we reproject to the Swiss coordinate system obtained from the vector data.\n\n# get the DEM with\nmdt &lt;- get_elev_raster(suiz, z = 10)\n\nmdt # old RasterLayer class\n\nplot(mdt)\n\n\n\n# convert to terra and mask area of interest\nmdt &lt;- rast(mdt) |&gt;\n  mask(vect(suiz))\n\n# reproject\nmdt &lt;- project(mdt, crs(suiz_lakes))\n\n# reproject vect\nsuiz &lt;- st_transform(suiz, st_crs(suiz_lakes))\n\nBefore calculating the shadow effect, we create a simple relief map. In ggplot2, we use the geom_raster() geometry, indicating the longitude, latitude and the variable to define the color. We add the boundaries of the lakes using geom_sf() since it is an sf object. Here we only indicate the fill color with a light blue. Then, with the help of scale_fill_hypso_tint_c(), we apply a range of colors corresponding to the relief, also called hypsometric tinting, and we define the breaks in the legend. We make appearance adjustments in the legend and the graph’s style in the rest of the functions.\n\n# convert the raster into a data.frame of xyz\nmdtdf &lt;- as.data.frame(mdt, xy = TRUE)\nnames(mdtdf)[3] &lt;- \"alt\"\n\n# map\nggplot() +\n  geom_raster(\n    data = mdtdf,\n    aes(x, y, fill = alt)\n  ) +\n  geom_sf(\n    data = suiz_lakes,\n    fill = \"#c6dbef\",\n    colour = NA\n  ) +\n  scale_fill_hypso_tint_c(breaks = c(\n    180, 250, 500, 1000,\n    1500, 2000, 2500,\n    3000, 3500, 4000\n  )) +\n  guides(fill = guide_colorsteps(\n    barwidth = 20,\n    barheight = .5,\n    title.position = \"right\"\n  )) +\n  labs(fill = \"m\") +\n  coord_sf() +\n  theme_void() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\")\n\n\nCalculate the hillshade\nLet’s remember that the hillshade effect is nothing more than adding a hypothetical illumination with respect to a position of a light source to gain depth. Shadows depend on two variables, azimuth, the angle from the orientation on the surface of a sphere, and elevation, the angle from the height of the source.\n\nThe information required to simulate lighting is the digital elevation model. The slope and aspect can be derived from the DEM using the terrain() function from the terra package. The unit must be radians. Once we have all the data, we can use the shade() function to indicate the angle (elevation) and direction (azimuth). The result is a raster with values between 0 and 255, which shows shadows with low values, being 0 black and 255 white.\n\n# estimate the slope\nsl &lt;- terrain(mdt, \"slope\", unit = \"radians\")\nplot(sl)\n\n\n\n\n\n# estimate the aspect or orientation\nasp &lt;- terrain(mdt, \"aspect\", unit = \"radians\")\nplot(asp)\n\n\n\n\n\n# calculate the hillshade effect with 45º of elevation\nhill_single &lt;- shade(sl, asp,\n  angle = 45,\n  direction = 300,\n  normalize = TRUE\n)\n\n# final hillshade\nplot(hill_single, col = grey(1:100 / 100))\n\n\n\n\nCombine the relief and shadow effect\nThe problem with adding both the relief with its hypsometric tints and the hillshade effect inside ggplot2 is that we have two different fills or scales for each layer. The solution is to use the ggnewscale extension, which allows you to add multiple scales of the same argument. First, we add the hillshade with geom_raster(), then we define the grey tones, and before adding the altitude, we include the new_scale_fill() function to mark a different fill. To achieve the effect, it is necessary to give a degree of transparency to the relief layer; in this case, it is 70%. The choice of direction is important, which is why we must always take into account the place and the apparent path of the sun (sunearthtools).\n\n# convert the hillshade to xyz\nhilldf_single &lt;- as.data.frame(hill_single, xy = TRUE)\n\n# map\nggplot() +\n  geom_raster(\n    data = hilldf_single,\n    aes(x, y, fill = hillshade),\n    show.legend = FALSE\n  ) +\n  scale_fill_distiller(palette = \"Greys\") +\n  new_scale_fill() +\n  geom_raster(\n    data = mdtdf,\n    aes(x, y, fill = alt),\n    alpha = .7\n  ) +\n  scale_fill_hypso_tint_c(breaks = c(\n    180, 250, 500, 1000,\n    1500, 2000, 2500,\n    3000, 3500, 4000\n  )) +\n  geom_sf(\n    data = suiz_lakes,\n    fill = \"#c6dbef\", colour = NA\n  ) +\n  guides(fill = guide_colorsteps(\n    barwidth = 20,\n    barheight = .5,\n    title.position = \"right\"\n  )) +\n  labs(fill = \"m\") +\n  coord_sf() +\n  theme_void() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\")\n\n\nMultidirectional shadows\nWe have seen a unidirectional effect; although it is the most common, we can create a smoother and even more realistic effect by combining several directions.\nWe map onto a vector of various directions to which the shade() function is applied with a fixed elevation angle. We then convert the raster list to a multi-layered object to reduce them by adding all the layers.\n\n# pass multiple directions to shade()\nhillmulti &lt;- map(c(270, 15, 60, 330), function(dir) {\n  shade(sl, asp,\n    angle = 45,\n    direction = dir,\n    normalize = TRUE\n  )\n})\n\n# create a multidimensional raster and reduce it by summing up\nhillmulti &lt;- rast(hillmulti) |&gt; sum()\n\n# multidirectional\nplot(hillmulti, col = grey(1:100 / 100))\n\n\n\n\n\n# unidirectional\nplot(hill_single, col = grey(1:100 / 100))\n\n\n\n\nWe do the same as before to visualize the relief with multidirectional shadows.\n\n# convert the hillshade to xyz\nhillmultidf &lt;- as.data.frame(hillmulti, xy = TRUE)\n\n# map\nggplot() +\n  geom_raster(\n    data = hillmultidf,\n    aes(x, y, fill = sum),\n    show.legend = FALSE\n  ) +\n  scale_fill_distiller(palette = \"Greys\") +\n  new_scale_fill() +\n  geom_raster(\n    data = mdtdf,\n    aes(x, y, fill = alt),\n    alpha = .7\n  ) +\n  scale_fill_hypso_tint_c(breaks = c(\n    180, 250, 500, 1000,\n    1500, 2000, 2500,\n    3000, 3500, 4000\n  )) +\n  geom_sf(\n    data = suiz_lakes,\n    fill = \"#c6dbef\", colour = NA\n  ) +\n  guides(fill = guide_colorsteps(\n    barwidth = 20,\n    barheight = .5,\n    title.position = \"right\"\n  )) +\n  labs(fill = \"m\") +\n  coord_sf() +\n  theme_void() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"top\")\n\n\n\n\nThe color blending technique is very useful to obtain remarkable results in the shading effect. Recently the ggblend package offers this possibility. In order to blend several layers, it is necessary to insert the geom_raster() and the scale_fill_*() objects in a comma-separated list. Then follows the pipe with the blend(\"mix_type\") function to which we add the other ggplot2 objects.

First we get the world boundaries with the gisco_get_countries() function and reproject them to the new Winkel II projection. Then we convert the raster data into a data.frame indicating to keep missing values. We can see that each layer of the raster (of each 30-minute interval) is a column in the data.frame. We rename the columns and convert the table into a long format using the pivot_longer() function. What we do is to merge all the columns of the layers into a single one.

Finally, we make use of { } from the rlang package within the filter()function to be able to filter our raster data in table form.

Since in both variables we find missing values, we correct those combinations between both variables where an NA appears.\n\n# create bivariate classification\nmapbivar &lt;- bi_class(mad, GINI_2017, RNMP_2017, style = \"quantile\", dim = 3) |&gt;\n              mutate(bi_class = ifelse(str_detect(bi_class, \"NA\"), NA, bi_class))\n\n# results\nhead(dplyr::select(mapbivar, GINI_2017, RNMP_2017, bi_class))\n\nWe finish by redistributing the inequality variable over the pixels of urban land use. The st_join() function joins the data with the land use points.\n\n# redistribute urban pixels to inequality\nmapdasi &lt;- st_join(urb_mad, st_transform(mapbivar, 4326))"

Unfortunately, as far as I know, it is not possible to extract the attributes with some function from the sf package. Although the function st_coordinates() returns the coordinates, it does not include other attributes. Therefore, we must use another way, and that is the open software Quantum GIS in which we can find a tool to extract all the vertice attributes. We could import the vector data into QGIS Desktop and export the vertices from there, but it is also possible to access the QGIS tools from R directly.\nFor this, we need to have QGIS installed. The qgisprocess package allows us to use very easily all the tools of the software in R. First we use the qgis_configure() function to define all the necessary QGIS paths.\n\n# paths to QGIS\nqgis_configure()\n\nThe qgis_algorithms() function helps us to search for different QGIS tools. In addition the qgis_show_help() function specifies the way of usage with all the required parameters.\n\n# search tools\nqgis_algorithms()\n\n\n# usage of tool\nqgis_show_help(\"native:extractvertices\")\n\nIn our case the tool to extract the vertices is simple and only has one input and one output. The function qgis_run_algorithm() executes a QGIS tool indicating the algorithm and its arguments. The advantage of using the algorithm directly from R is that we can pass objects of class sf (or sp) and raster that we have imported or created in R. As output we create a geojson, it could also be of another vector format, and we save it in a temporary folder.

    "text": "Preparing the data\nFirst we import the daily precipitation and temperature data from the selected weather station (download). We will use the data from Tenerife South (Spain) [1981-2020] accessible through Open Data AEMET. In R there is a package called meteoland that facilitates the download with specific functions to access data from AEMET (Spanish State Meteorological Agency), Meteogalicia (Galician Meteorological Service) and Meteocat (Catalan Meteorological Service).\nStep 1: import the data\nWe import the data in csv format, the first column is the date, the second column the precipitation (pr) and the last column the average daily temperature (ta).\n\ndata &lt;- read_csv(\"meteo_tenerife.csv\")\ndata\n\nStep 2: preparing the data\nIn the second step we prepare the data to calculate the anomalies. To do this, we create three new columns: the month, the year, and the season of the year. Since our objective is to analyse winter anomalies, we cannot use the calendar year, because winter includes the month of December of one year and the months of January and February of the following. The concept is similar to the hydrological year in which it starts on October 1.\nWe will use many functions of the package collection tidyverse. The mutate() function helps to add new columns or change existing ones. To define the seasons, we use the case_when() function from the dplyr package, which has many advantages compared to a chain of ifelse(). In case_when() we use two-side formulas, on the one hand the condition and on the other the action when that condition is met. A two-sided formula in R consists of the operator ~. The binary operator %in% allows us to filter several values in a greater set.\n\ndata &lt;- mutate(data,\n  winter_yr = ifelse(month(date) == 12, year(date)+1, year(date)),\n  month = month(date),\n  season = case_when(\n    month %in% c(12, 1:2) ~ \"Winter\",\n    month %in% 3:5 ~ \"Spring\",\n    month %in% 6:8 ~ \"Summer\",\n    month %in% 9:11 ~ \"Autum\"\n  )\n)\n\ndata\n\nStep 3: estimate winter anomalies\nIn the next step we create a subset of the winter months. Then we group by the defined meteorological year and calculate the sum and average for precipitation and temperature, respectively. To facilitate the work, the magrittr package and later R Base introduces the operator called pipe in the form %&gt;% and |&gt; with the aim of combining several functions without the need to assign the result to a new object. The pipe operator passes the output of a function applied to the first argument of the next function. This way of combining functions allows you to chain several steps simultaneously. The |&gt; must be understood and pronounced as then.\n\ndata_inv &lt;- filter(\n  data,\n  season == \"Winter\"\n) |&gt;\n  group_by(winter_yr) |&gt;\n  summarise(\n    pr = sum(pr, na.rm = TRUE),\n    ta = mean(ta, na.rm = TRUE)\n  )\n\nNow we only have to calculate the anomalies of precipitation and temperature. The columns pr_mean and ta_mean will contain the climate average, the reference for the anomalies with respect to the normal period 1981-2010. Therefore, we need to filter the values to the period before 2010, which we will do in the usual way of filtering vectors in R. Once we have the references we estimate the anomalies pr_anom and ta_anom. To facilitate the interpretation, in the case of precipitation we express the anomalies as percentage, with the average set at 0% instead of 100%.\nIn addition, we add three required columns with information for the creation of the graph: 1) labyr contains the year of each anomaly as long as it has been greater/less than -+10% or -+0.5ºC, respectively (this is for reducing the number of labels), 2) symb_point is a dummy variable in order to be able to create different symbols between the cases of (1), and 3) lab_font for highlighting in bold the year 2020.\n\ndata_inv &lt;- mutate(data_inv,\n  pr_mean = mean(pr[winter_yr &lt;= 2010]),\n  ta_mean = mean(ta[winter_yr &lt;= 2010]),\n  pr_anom = (pr * 100 / pr_mean) - 100,\n  ta_anom = ta - ta_mean,\n  labyr = case_when(\n    pr_anom &lt; -10 & ta_anom &lt; -.5 ~ winter_yr,\n    pr_anom &lt; -10 & ta_anom &gt; .5 ~ winter_yr,\n    pr_anom &gt; 10 & ta_anom &lt; -.5 ~ winter_yr,\n    pr_anom &gt; 10 & ta_anom &gt; .5 ~ winter_yr\n  ),\n  symb_point = ifelse(!is.na(labyr), \"yes\", \"no\"),\n  lab_font = ifelse(labyr == 2020, \"bold\", \"plain\")\n)"

Therefore, we must invert the sign in the precipitation anomalies. Then we create a data.frame with the label positions of the four quadrants. For the positions in x and y Inf and -Inf are used, which is equivalent to the maximum panel sides with respect to the data. However, it is necessary to adjust the position towards the extreme points within the panel with the known arguments of ggplot2: hjust and vjust.\n\ndata_inv_p &lt;- mutate(data_inv, pr_anom = pr_anom * -1)\n\nbglab &lt;- data.frame(\n  x = c(-Inf, Inf, -Inf, Inf),\n  y = c(Inf, Inf, -Inf, -Inf),\n  hjust = c(1, 1, 0, 0),\n  vjust = c(1, 0, 1, 0),\n  lab = c(\n    \"Wet-Warm\", \"Dry-Warm\",\n    \"Wet-Cold\", \"Dry-Cold\"\n  )\n)\n\n\nbglab\n\nPart 2\nIn the second part we can start building the chart by adding all graphical elements. First we create the background with different colors of each quadrant. The function annotate() allows adding geometry layers without the use of variables within data.frames. With the geom_hline() and geom_vline() function we mark the quadrants horizontally and vertically using a dashed line. Finally, we draw the labels of each quadrant, using the function geom_text().

The philosophy of the package follows the same as in ggplot2, creating multiple layers with different functions, which always start with tm_*and combine with +. Building a map with tmap always starts with tm_shape(), where the data, we want to draw, is defined. Then we add the corresponding geometry to the data type (tm_polygon(), tm_border(), tm_dots() or even tm_raster()). The tm_layout() function help us to configure the map style.\nWhen we need more colors than the maximum allowed by RColorBrewer, we can pass the colors to the colorRampPalette() function.

We skip the first 21 rows that contain information about the weather station. In addition, we convert the date to the date class and replace missing values (-9999) with NA. The precipitation is given in 0.1 mm, therefore, we must divide the values by 10.

Obviously OSM not only contains streets and highways, but also information that can be useful when we use a map such as locations of hospitals or gas stations. To avoid downloading the entire OSM and extracting the required information, you can use an overpass API, which allows us to query the OSM database with our own criteria.\nAn easy way to access an overpass API is through overpass-turbo.eu, which even includes a wizard to build a query and display the results on a interactive map. A detailed explanation of the previous web can be found here. However, we have at our disposal a package osmdata that allows us to create and make queries directly from the R environment. Nevertheless, the use of the overpass-turbo.eu can be useful when we are not sure what we are looking for or when we have some difficulty in building the query."

    "text": "Build a query\nBefore creating a query, we need to know what we can filter. The available_features() function returns a list of available OSM features that have different tags. More details are available in the OSM wiki here. For example, the feature shop contains several tags among others supermarket, fishing, books, etc.\n\n# the first five features\nhead(available_features())\n\n\n# amenities\nhead(available_tags(\"amenity\"))\n\n\n# shops\nhead(available_tags(\"shop\"))\n\nThe first query: Where are cinemas in Madrid?\nTo build the query, we use the pipe operator |&gt; from R Base, which helps to chain several functions without assigning the result to a new object. The first pipe in R was %&gt;% very extended especially within the tidyverse package collection. If you want to know more about its use, you can find here a tutorial or some details on differences between both here.\nIn the first part of the query we need to indicate the place where we want to extract the information. The getbb() function creates a boundering box for a given place, looking for the name. The main function is opq() which build the final query. We add our filter criteria with the add_osm_feature() function. In this first query we will look for cinemas in Madrid. That’s why we use as key amenity and cinema as tag. There are several formats to obtain the resulting spatial data of the query. The osmdata_*() function sends the query to the server and, depending on the suffix * sf/sp/xml, returns a simple feature, spatial or XML format.\n\n# building the query\nq &lt;- getbb(\"Madrid\") |&gt;\n  opq() |&gt;\n  add_osm_feature(\"amenity\", \"cinema\")\n\nstr(q) # query structure\n\n\ncinema &lt;- osmdata_sf(q)\ncinema\n\nWe see that the result is a list of different spatial objects. In our case, we are only interested in osm_points.\nHow can we visulise these points?\nThe advantage of sf objects is that for ggplot2 already exists a geometry function geom_sf(). Furthermore, we can include a background map using ggmap. The get_map() function downloads the map for a given place. Alternatively, it can be an address, latitude/longitude or a bounding box. The maptype argument allows us to indicate the style or type of map. You can find more details in the help of the ?get_map function.\nWhen we build a graph with ggplot we usually start with ggplot(). In this case, we start with ggmap() that includes the object with our background map. Then we add with geom_sf() the points of the cinemas in Madrid. It is important to indicate with the argument inherit.aes = FALSE that it has to use the aesthetic mappings of the spatial object osm_points. In addition, we change the color, fill, transparency (alpha), type and size of the circles.\nYou need to register your key for Stadia Maps: register_stadiamaps(_key_)\n\n# our background map\nmad_map &lt;- get_map(getbb(\"Madrid\"), maptype = \"stamen_toner_background\")\n\n# final map\nggmap(mad_map) +\n  geom_sf(\n    data = cinema$osm_points,\n    inherit.aes = FALSE,\n    colour = \"#238443\",\n    fill = \"#004529\",\n    alpha = .5,\n    size = 4,\n    shape = 21\n  ) +\n  theme_void()\n\n\n\n\nWhere can we find Mercadona supermarkets?\nInstead of obtaining a bounding box with the function getbb() we can build our own box. To do this, we create a vector of four elements, the order has to be West/South/East/North. In the query we use two features: name and shop to filter supermarkets that are of this particular brand. Depending on the area or volume of the query, it is necessary to extend the waiting time. By default, the limit is set at 25 seconds (timeout).\nThe map, we create in this case, consists only of the supermarket points. Therefore, we use the usual grammar by adding the geometry geom_sf(). The theme_void() function removes everything except for the points.\n\n# bounding box for the Iberian Peninsula\nm &lt;- c(-10, 30, 5, 46)\n\n# building the query\nq &lt;- m |&gt;\n  opq(timeout = 25 * 100) |&gt;\n  add_osm_feature(\"name\", \"Mercadona\") |&gt;\n  add_osm_feature(\"shop\", \"supermarket\")\n\n# query\nmercadona &lt;- osmdata_sf(q)\n\n# final map\nggplot(mercadona$osm_points) +\n  geom_sf(\n    colour = \"#08519c\",\n    fill = \"#08306b\",\n    alpha = .5,\n    size = 1,\n    shape = 21\n  ) +\n  theme_void()"

Increasing greenness has been suggested as a mitigation strategy due to its cooling effect and potential to modify the heat–mortality association. This study aimed to comprehensively estimate the effects of increased greenness on heat-related deaths. Methods: We applied a multistage meta-analytical approach to estimate the potential reduction in global heat-related deaths by increasing greenness in the warm season in 2000–19 in 11 534 urban areas. We used the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) to indicate greenness and a random forest model to predict daily temperatures in counterfactual EVI scenarios. In the factual EVI scenarios, daily mortality and weather variables from 830 locations in 53 countries were extracted from the Multi-Country Multi-City Collaborative Research Network and used to assess heat–mortality associations. These associations were then extrapolated to each urban area under both factual and counterfactual EVI scenarios based on meta-regression models. Findings: We estimated that EVI increased by 10% would decrease the global population-weighted warm-season mean temperature by 0·08°C, EVI increased by 20% would decrease temperature by 0.14C, and EVI increased by 30% would decrease temperature by 0.19C. In the factual scenario, 3 153 225 (2,48%) of 127 179 341 total deaths could be attributed to heat exposure. The attributable fraction of heat-related deaths (as a fraction of total deaths) in 2000–19 would decrease by 0.67 (95% empirical CI 0.53–0.82) percentage points in the 10% scenario, 0.80 (0.63–0.97) percentage points in the 20% scenario, and 0.91 (0.72–1.10) percentage points in the 30% scenario, compared with the factual scenario. South Europe was modelled to have the largest decrease in attributable fraction of heat-related mortality. Interpretation: This modelling study suggests that increased greenness could substantially reduce the heat-related mortality burden.

The attributable fraction of heat-related deaths (as a fraction of total deaths) in 2000–19 would decrease by 0.67 (95% empirical CI 0.53–0.82) percentage points in the 10% scenario, 0.80 (0.63–0.97) percentage points in the 20% scenario, and 0.91 (0.72–1.10) percentage points in the 30% scenario, compared with the factual scenario. South Europe was modelled to have the largest decrease in attributable fraction of heat-related mortality. Interpretation: This modelling study suggests that increased greenness could substantially reduce the heat-related mortality burden.

Increasing greenness has been suggested as a mitigation strategy due to its cooling effect and potential to modify the heat–mortality association. This study aimed to comprehensively estimate the effects of increased greenness on heat-related deaths. Methods: We applied a multistage meta-analytical approach to estimate the potential reduction in global heat-related deaths by increasing greenness in the warm season in 2000–19 in 11 534 urban areas. We used the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) to indicate greenness and a random forest model to predict daily temperatures in counterfactual EVI scenarios. In the factual EVI scenarios, daily mortality and weather variables from 830 locations in 53 countries were extracted from the Multi-Country Multi-City Collaborative Research Network and used to assess heat–mortality associations. These associations were then extrapolated to each urban area under both factual and counterfactual EVI scenarios based on meta-regression models. Findings: We estimated that EVI increased by 10% would decrease the global population-weighted warm-season mean temperature by 0·08°C, EVI increased by 20% would decrease temperature by 0.14C, and EVI increased by 30% would decrease temperature by 0.19C.

Estimating the urban heat-related mortality burden due to greenness: a global modelling study. The Lancet Planetary Health. doi: 10.1016/S2542-5196(25)00062-2 .. \n\n\nBackground: Heat exposure poses a substantial public health threat. Increasing greenness has been suggested as a mitigation strategy due to its cooling effect and potential to modify the heat–mortality association. This study aimed to comprehensively estimate the effects of increased greenness on heat-related deaths. Methods: We applied a multistage meta-analytical approach to estimate the potential reduction in global heat-related deaths by increasing greenness in the warm season in 2000–19 in 11 534 urban areas. We used the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) to indicate greenness and a random forest model to predict daily temperatures in counterfactual EVI scenarios. In the factual EVI scenarios, daily mortality and weather variables from 830 locations in 53 countries were extracted from the Multi-Country Multi-City Collaborative Research Network and used to assess heat–mortality associations. These associations were then extrapolated to each urban area under both factual and counterfactual EVI scenarios based on meta-regression models. Findings: We estimated that EVI increased by 10% would decrease the global population-weighted warm-season mean temperature by 0·08°C, EVI increased by 20% would decrease temperature by 0.14C, and EVI increased by 30% would decrease temperature by 0.19C. In the factual scenario, 3 153 225 (2,48%) of 127 179 341 total deaths could be attributed to heat exposure.

This study aimed to comprehensively estimate the effects of increased greenness on heat-related deaths. Methods: We applied a multistage meta-analytical approach to estimate the potential reduction in global heat-related deaths by increasing greenness in the warm season in 2000–19 in 11 534 urban areas. We used the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) to indicate greenness and a random forest model to predict daily temperatures in counterfactual EVI scenarios. In the factual EVI scenarios, daily mortality and weather variables from 830 locations in 53 countries were extracted from the Multi-Country Multi-City Collaborative Research Network and used to assess heat–mortality associations. These associations were then extrapolated to each urban area under both factual and counterfactual EVI scenarios based on meta-regression models. Findings: We estimated that EVI increased by 10% would decrease the global population-weighted warm-season mean temperature by 0·08°C, EVI increased by 20% would decrease temperature by 0.14C, and EVI increased by 30% would decrease temperature by 0.19C. In the factual scenario, 3 153 225 (2,48%) of 127 179 341 total deaths could be attributed to heat exposure. The attributable fraction of heat-related deaths (as a fraction of total deaths) in 2000–19 would decrease by 0.67 (95% empirical CI 0.53–0.82) percentage points in the 10% scenario, 0.80 (0.63–0.97) percentage points in the 20% scenario, and 0.91 (0.72–1.10) percentage points in the 30% scenario, compared with the factual scenario. South Europe was modelled to have the largest decrease in attributable fraction of heat-related mortality. Interpretation: This modelling study suggests that increased greenness could substantially reduce the heat-related mortality burden. Preserving and expanding greenness might be potential strategies to lower ambient temperature and reduce the health impacts of heat exposure. greenness heat mortality exposure modification\n\n\ngreenness, heat, mortality, exposure, modification"

Estimating the urban heat-related mortality burden due to greenness: a global modelling study. The Lancet Planetary Health. doi: 10.1016/S2542-5196(25)00062-2 .. \n\n\nBackground: Heat exposure poses a substantial public health threat. Increasing greenness has been suggested as a mitigation strategy due to its cooling effect and potential to modify the heat–mortality association. This study aimed to comprehensively estimate the effects of increased greenness on heat-related deaths. Methods: We applied a multistage meta-analytical approach to estimate the potential reduction in global heat-related deaths by increasing greenness in the warm season in 2000–19 in 11 534 urban areas. We used the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) to indicate greenness and a random forest model to predict daily temperatures in counterfactual EVI scenarios. In the factual EVI scenarios, daily mortality and weather variables from 830 locations in 53 countries were extracted from the Multi-Country Multi-City Collaborative Research Network and used to assess heat–mortality associations. These associations were then extrapolated to each urban area under both factual and counterfactual EVI scenarios based on meta-regression models. Findings: We estimated that EVI increased by 10% would decrease the global population-weighted warm-season mean temperature by 0·08°C, EVI increased by 20% would decrease temperature by 0.14C, and EVI increased by 30% would decrease temperature by 0.19C. In the factual scenario, 3 153 225 (2,48%) of 127 179 341 total deaths could be attributed to heat exposure. The attributable fraction of heat-related deaths (as a fraction of total deaths) in 2000–19 would decrease by 0.67 (95% empirical CI 0.53–0.82) percentage points in the 10% scenario, 0.80 (0.63–0.97) percentage points in the 20% scenario, and 0.91 (0.72–1.10) percentage points in the 30% scenario, compared with the factual scenario.

Increasing greenness has been suggested as a mitigation strategy due to its cooling effect and potential to modify the heat–mortality association. This study aimed to comprehensively estimate the effects of increased greenness on heat-related deaths. Methods: We applied a multistage meta-analytical approach to estimate the potential reduction in global heat-related deaths by increasing greenness in the warm season in 2000–19 in 11 534 urban areas. We used the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) to indicate greenness and a random forest model to predict daily temperatures in counterfactual EVI scenarios. In the factual EVI scenarios, daily mortality and weather variables from 830 locations in 53 countries were extracted from the Multi-Country Multi-City Collaborative Research Network and used to assess heat–mortality associations. These associations were then extrapolated to each urban area under both factual and counterfactual EVI scenarios based on meta-regression models. Findings: We estimated that EVI increased by 10% would decrease the global population-weighted warm-season mean temperature by 0·08°C, EVI increased by 20% would decrease temperature by 0.14C, and EVI increased by 30% would decrease temperature by 0.19C. In the factual scenario, 3 153 225 (2,48%) of 127 179 341 total deaths could be attributed to heat exposure. The attributable fraction of heat-related deaths (as a fraction of total deaths) in 2000–19 would decrease by 0.67 (95% empirical CI 0.53–0.82) percentage points in the 10% scenario, 0.80 (0.63–0.97) percentage points in the 20% scenario, and 0.91 (0.72–1.10) percentage points in the 30% scenario, compared with the factual scenario. South Europe was modelled to have the largest decrease in attributable fraction of heat-related mortality. Interpretation: This modelling study suggests that increased greenness could substantially reduce the heat-related mortality burden. Preserving and expanding greenness might be potential strategies to lower ambient temperature and reduce the health impacts of heat exposure. greenness heat mortality exposure modification\n\n\ngreenness, heat, mortality, exposure, modification"

Estimating the urban heat-related mortality burden due to greenness: a global modelling study. The Lancet Planetary Health. doi: 10.1016/S2542-5196(25)00062-2 .. \n\n\nBackground: Heat exposure poses a substantial public health threat. Increasing greenness has been suggested as a mitigation strategy due to its cooling effect and potential to modify the heat–mortality association. This study aimed to comprehensively estimate the effects of increased greenness on heat-related deaths. Methods: We applied a multistage meta-analytical approach to estimate the potential reduction in global heat-related deaths by increasing greenness in the warm season in 2000–19 in 11 534 urban areas. We used the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) to indicate greenness and a random forest model to predict daily temperatures in counterfactual EVI scenarios. In the factual EVI scenarios, daily mortality and weather variables from 830 locations in 53 countries were extracted from the Multi-Country Multi-City Collaborative Research Network and used to assess heat–mortality associations. These associations were then extrapolated to each urban area under both factual and counterfactual EVI scenarios based on meta-regression models. Findings: We estimated that EVI increased by 10% would decrease the global population-weighted warm-season mean temperature by 0·08°C, EVI increased by 20% would decrease temperature by 0.14C, and EVI increased by 30% would decrease temperature by 0.19C. In the factual scenario, 3 153 225 (2,48%) of 127 179 341 total deaths could be attributed to heat exposure. The attributable fraction of heat-related deaths (as a fraction of total deaths) in 2000–19 would decrease by 0.67 (95% empirical CI 0.53–0.82) percentage points in the 10% scenario, 0.80 (0.63–0.97) percentage points in the 20% scenario, and 0.91 (0.72–1.10) percentage points in the 30% scenario, compared with the factual scenario. South Europe was modelled to have the largest decrease in attributable fraction of heat-related mortality.

Methods: We applied a multistage meta-analytical approach to estimate the potential reduction in global heat-related deaths by increasing greenness in the warm season in 2000–19 in 11 534 urban areas. We used the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) to indicate greenness and a random forest model to predict daily temperatures in counterfactual EVI scenarios. In the factual EVI scenarios, daily mortality and weather variables from 830 locations in 53 countries were extracted from the Multi-Country Multi-City Collaborative Research Network and used to assess heat–mortality associations. These associations were then extrapolated to each urban area under both factual and counterfactual EVI scenarios based on meta-regression models. Findings: We estimated that EVI increased by 10% would decrease the global population-weighted warm-season mean temperature by 0·08°C, EVI increased by 20% would decrease temperature by 0.14C, and EVI increased by 30% would decrease temperature by 0.19C. In the factual scenario, 3 153 225 (2,48%) of 127 179 341 total deaths could be attributed to heat exposure. The attributable fraction of heat-related deaths (as a fraction of total deaths) in 2000–19 would decrease by 0.67 (95% empirical CI 0.53–0.82) percentage points in the 10% scenario, 0.80 (0.63–0.97) percentage points in the 20% scenario, and 0.91 (0.72–1.10) percentage points in the 30% scenario, compared with the factual scenario. South Europe was modelled to have the largest decrease in attributable fraction of heat-related mortality. Interpretation: This modelling study suggests that increased greenness could substantially reduce the heat-related mortality burden. Preserving and expanding greenness might be potential strategies to lower ambient temperature and reduce the health impacts of heat exposure. greenness heat mortality exposure modification\n\n\ngreenness, heat, mortality, exposure, modification"

The attributable fraction of heat-related deaths (as a fraction of total deaths) in 2000–19 would decrease by 0.67 (95% empirical CI 0.53–0.82) percentage points in the 10% scenario, 0.80 (0.63–0.97) percentage points in the 20% scenario, and 0.91 (0.72–1.10) percentage points in the 30% scenario, compared with the factual scenario. South Europe was modelled to have the largest decrease in attributable fraction of heat-related mortality. Interpretation: This modelling study suggests that increased greenness could substantially reduce the heat-related mortality burden.

Increasing greenness has been suggested as a mitigation strategy due to its cooling effect and potential to modify the heat–mortality association. This study aimed to comprehensively estimate the effects of increased greenness on heat-related deaths. Methods: We applied a multistage meta-analytical approach to estimate the potential reduction in global heat-related deaths by increasing greenness in the warm season in 2000–19 in 11 534 urban areas. We used the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) to indicate greenness and a random forest model to predict daily temperatures in counterfactual EVI scenarios. In the factual EVI scenarios, daily mortality and weather variables from 830 locations in 53 countries were extracted from the Multi-Country Multi-City Collaborative Research Network and used to assess heat–mortality associations. These associations were then extrapolated to each urban area under both factual and counterfactual EVI scenarios based on meta-regression models. Findings: We estimated that EVI increased by 10% would decrease the global population-weighted warm-season mean temperature by 0·08°C, EVI increased by 20% would decrease temperature by 0.14C, and EVI increased by 30% would decrease temperature by 0.19C.

The attributable fraction of heat-related deaths (as a fraction of total deaths) in 2000–19 would decrease by 0.67 (95% empirical CI 0.53–0.82) percentage points in the 10% scenario, 0.80 (0.63–0.97) percentage points in the 20% scenario, and 0.91 (0.72–1.10) percentage points in the 30% scenario, compared with the factual scenario. South Europe was modelled to have the largest decrease in attributable fraction of heat-related mortality.

Increasing greenness has been suggested as a mitigation strategy due to its cooling effect and potential to modify the heat–mortality association. This study aimed to comprehensively estimate the effects of increased greenness on heat-related deaths. Methods: We applied a multistage meta-analytical approach to estimate the potential reduction in global heat-related deaths by increasing greenness in the warm season in 2000–19 in 11 534 urban areas. We used the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) to indicate greenness and a random forest model to predict daily temperatures in counterfactual EVI scenarios. In the factual EVI scenarios, daily mortality and weather variables from 830 locations in 53 countries were extracted from the Multi-Country Multi-City Collaborative Research Network and used to assess heat–mortality associations.

Findings: We estimated that EVI increased by 10% would decrease the global population-weighted warm-season mean temperature by 0·08°C, EVI increased by 20% would decrease temperature by 0.14C, and EVI increased by 30% would decrease temperature by 0.19C.

Estimating the urban heat-related mortality burden due to greenness: a global modelling study. The Lancet Planetary Health. doi: 10.1016/S2542-5196(25)00062-2 .. \n\n\nBackground: Heat exposure poses a substantial public health threat. Increasing greenness has been suggested as a mitigation strategy due to its cooling effect and potential to modify the heat–mortality association. This study aimed to comprehensively estimate the effects of increased greenness on heat-related deaths. Methods: We applied a multistage meta-analytical approach to estimate the potential reduction in global heat-related deaths by increasing greenness in the warm season in 2000–19 in 11 534 urban areas. We used the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) to indicate greenness and a random forest model to predict daily temperatures in counterfactual EVI scenarios. In the factual EVI scenarios, daily mortality and weather variables from 830 locations in 53 countries were extracted from the Multi-Country Multi-City Collaborative Research Network and used to assess heat–mortality associations. These associations were then extrapolated to each urban area under both factual and counterfactual EVI scenarios based on meta-regression models. Findings: We estimated that EVI increased by 10% would decrease the global population-weighted warm-season mean temperature by 0·08°C, EVI increased by 20% would decrease temperature by 0.14C, and EVI increased by 30% would decrease temperature by 0.19C. In the factual scenario, 3 153 225 (2,48%) of 127 179 341 total deaths could be attributed to heat exposure. The attributable fraction of heat-related deaths (as a fraction of total deaths) in 2000–19 would decrease by 0.67 (95% empirical CI 0.53–0.82) percentage points in the 10% scenario, 0.80 (0.63–0.97) percentage points in the 20% scenario, and 0.91 (0.72–1.10) percentage points in the 30% scenario, compared with the factual scenario. South Europe was modelled to have the largest decrease in attributable fraction of heat-related mortality. Interpretation: This modelling study suggests that increased greenness could substantially reduce the heat-related mortality burden. Preserving and expanding greenness might be potential strategies to lower ambient temperature and reduce the health impacts of heat exposure. greenness heat mortality exposure modification\n\n\ngreenness, heat, mortality, exposure, modification\n\n\n\n\n\nWu Y, Wen B, Ye T, Huang W, Liu Y, Gasparrini A, Sera F, Tong S, Lavigne E, Royé D, Achilleos S, Ryti N, Pascal M, Zeka A, deDonato F, Pereira da Silva S, Madureira J, Mistry M, Armstrong B, Bell M, Schwartz J, Guo Y, Li S (2025).

In the factual EVI scenarios, daily mortality and weather variables from 830 locations in 53 countries were extracted from the Multi-Country Multi-City Collaborative Research Network and used to assess heat–mortality associations. These associations were then extrapolated to each urban area under both factual and counterfactual EVI scenarios based on meta-regression models. Findings: We estimated that EVI increased by 10% would decrease the global population-weighted warm-season mean temperature by 0·08°C, EVI increased by 20% would decrease temperature by 0.14C, and EVI increased by 30% would decrease temperature by 0.19C. In the factual scenario, 3 153 225 (2,48%) of 127 179 341 total deaths could be attributed to heat exposure. The attributable fraction of heat-related deaths (as a fraction of total deaths) in 2000–19 would decrease by 0.67 (95% empirical CI 0.53–0.82) percentage points in the 10% scenario, 0.80 (0.63–0.97) percentage points in the 20% scenario, and 0.91 (0.72–1.10) percentage points in the 30% scenario, compared with the factual scenario. South Europe was modelled to have the largest decrease in attributable fraction of heat-related mortality. Interpretation: This modelling study suggests that increased greenness could substantially reduce the heat-related mortality burden.

The attributable fraction of heat-related deaths (as a fraction of total deaths) in 2000–19 would decrease by 0.67 (95% empirical CI 0.53–0.82) percentage points in the 10% scenario, 0.80 (0.63–0.97) percentage points in the 20% scenario, and 0.91 (0.72–1.10) percentage points in the 30% scenario, compared with the factual scenario. South Europe was modelled to have the largest decrease in attributable fraction of heat-related mortality.

Methods: We applied a multistage meta-analytical approach to estimate the potential reduction in global heat-related deaths by increasing greenness in the warm season in 2000–19 in 11 534 urban areas. We used the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) to indicate greenness and a random forest model to predict daily temperatures in counterfactual EVI scenarios.

The Lancet Planetary Health. doi: 10.1016/S2542-5196(25)00062-2 .. \n\n\nBackground: Heat exposure poses a substantial public health threat. Increasing greenness has been suggested as a mitigation strategy due to its cooling effect and potential to modify the heat–mortality association. This study aimed to comprehensively estimate the effects of increased greenness on heat-related deaths. Methods: We applied a multistage meta-analytical approach to estimate the potential reduction in global heat-related deaths by increasing greenness in the warm season in 2000–19 in 11 534 urban areas. We used the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) to indicate greenness and a random forest model to predict daily temperatures in counterfactual EVI scenarios. In the factual EVI scenarios, daily mortality and weather variables from 830 locations in 53 countries were extracted from the Multi-Country Multi-City Collaborative Research Network and used to assess heat–mortality associations. These associations were then extrapolated to each urban area under both factual and counterfactual EVI scenarios based on meta-regression models. Findings: We estimated that EVI increased by 10% would decrease the global population-weighted warm-season mean temperature by 0·08°C, EVI increased by 20% would decrease temperature by 0.14C, and EVI increased by 30% would decrease temperature by 0.19C. In the factual scenario, 3 153 225 (2,48%) of 127 179 341 total deaths could be attributed to heat exposure. The attributable fraction of heat-related deaths (as a fraction of total deaths) in 2000–19 would decrease by 0.67 (95% empirical CI 0.53–0.82) percentage points in the 10% scenario, 0.80 (0.63–0.97) percentage points in the 20% scenario, and 0.91 (0.72–1.10) percentage points in the 30% scenario, compared with the factual scenario. South Europe was modelled to have the largest decrease in attributable fraction of heat-related mortality. Interpretation: This modelling study suggests that increased greenness could substantially reduce the heat-related mortality burden. Preserving and expanding greenness might be potential strategies to lower ambient temperature and reduce the health impacts of heat exposure. greenness heat mortality exposure modification\n\n\ngreenness, heat, mortality, exposure, modification"

The attributable fraction of heat-related deaths (as a fraction of total deaths) in 2000–19 would decrease by 0.67 (95% empirical CI 0.53–0.82) percentage points in the 10% scenario, 0.80 (0.63–0.97) percentage points in the 20% scenario, and 0.91 (0.72–1.10) percentage points in the 30% scenario, compared with the factual scenario. South Europe was modelled to have the largest decrease in attributable fraction of heat-related mortality. Interpretation: This modelling study suggests that increased greenness could substantially reduce the heat-related mortality burden.

Increasing greenness has been suggested as a mitigation strategy due to its cooling effect and potential to modify the heat–mortality association. This study aimed to comprehensively estimate the effects of increased greenness on heat-related deaths. Methods: We applied a multistage meta-analytical approach to estimate the potential reduction in global heat-related deaths by increasing greenness in the warm season in 2000–19 in 11 534 urban areas. We used the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) to indicate greenness and a random forest model to predict daily temperatures in counterfactual EVI scenarios. In the factual EVI scenarios, daily mortality and weather variables from 830 locations in 53 countries were extracted from the Multi-Country Multi-City Collaborative Research Network and used to assess heat–mortality associations. These associations were then extrapolated to each urban area under both factual and counterfactual EVI scenarios based on meta-regression models. Findings: We estimated that EVI increased by 10% would decrease the global population-weighted warm-season mean temperature by 0·08°C, EVI increased by 20% would decrease temperature by 0.14C, and EVI increased by 30% would decrease temperature by 0.19C.

Estimating the urban heat-related mortality burden due to greenness: a global modelling study. The Lancet Planetary Health. doi: 10.1016/S2542-5196(25)00062-2 .. \n\n\nBackground: Heat exposure poses a substantial public health threat. Increasing greenness has been suggested as a mitigation strategy due to its cooling effect and potential to modify the heat–mortality association. This study aimed to comprehensively estimate the effects of increased greenness on heat-related deaths. Methods: We applied a multistage meta-analytical approach to estimate the potential reduction in global heat-related deaths by increasing greenness in the warm season in 2000–19 in 11 534 urban areas. We used the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) to indicate greenness and a random forest model to predict daily temperatures in counterfactual EVI scenarios. In the factual EVI scenarios, daily mortality and weather variables from 830 locations in 53 countries were extracted from the Multi-Country Multi-City Collaborative Research Network and used to assess heat–mortality associations. These associations were then extrapolated to each urban area under both factual and counterfactual EVI scenarios based on meta-regression models. Findings: We estimated that EVI increased by 10% would decrease the global population-weighted warm-season mean temperature by 0·08°C, EVI increased by 20% would decrease temperature by 0.14C, and EVI increased by 30% would decrease temperature by 0.19C. In the factual scenario, 3 153 225 (2,48%) of 127 179 341 total deaths could be attributed to heat exposure. The attributable fraction of heat-related deaths (as a fraction of total deaths) in 2000–19 would decrease by 0.67 (95% empirical CI 0.53–0.82) percentage points in the 10% scenario, 0.80 (0.63–0.97) percentage points in the 20% scenario, and 0.91 (0.72–1.10) percentage points in the 30% scenario, compared with the factual scenario. South Europe was modelled to have the largest decrease in attributable fraction of heat-related mortality. Interpretation: This modelling study suggests that increased greenness could substantially reduce the heat-related mortality burden. Preserving and expanding greenness might be potential strategies to lower ambient temperature and reduce the health impacts of heat exposure. greenness heat mortality exposure modification\n\n\ngreenness, heat, mortality, exposure, modification"

In the factual scenario, 3 153 225 (2,48%) of 127 179 341 total deaths could be attributed to heat exposure. The attributable fraction of heat-related deaths (as a fraction of total deaths) in 2000–19 would decrease by 0.67 (95% empirical CI 0.53–0.82) percentage points in the 10% scenario, 0.80 (0.63–0.97) percentage points in the 20% scenario, and 0.91 (0.72–1.10) percentage points in the 30% scenario, compared with the factual scenario. South Europe was modelled to have the largest decrease in attributable fraction of heat-related mortality. Interpretation: This modelling study suggests that increased greenness could substantially reduce the heat-related mortality burden. Preserving and expanding greenness might be potential strategies to lower ambient temperature and reduce the health impacts of heat exposure. greenness heat mortality exposure modification\n\n\ngreenness, heat, mortality, exposure, modification"

Increasing greenness has been suggested as a mitigation strategy due to its cooling effect and potential to modify the heat–mortality association. This study aimed to comprehensively estimate the effects of increased greenness on heat-related deaths. Methods: We applied a multistage meta-analytical approach to estimate the potential reduction in global heat-related deaths by increasing greenness in the warm season in 2000–19 in 11 534 urban areas. We used the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) to indicate greenness and a random forest model to predict daily temperatures in counterfactual EVI scenarios.

Estimating the urban heat-related mortality burden due to greenness: a global modelling study. The Lancet Planetary Health. doi: 10.1016/S2542-5196(25)00062-2 .. \n\n\nBackground: Heat exposure poses a substantial public health threat. Increasing greenness has been suggested as a mitigation strategy due to its cooling effect and potential to modify the heat–mortality association. This study aimed to comprehensively estimate the effects of increased greenness on heat-related deaths. Methods: We applied a multistage meta-analytical approach to estimate the potential reduction in global heat-related deaths by increasing greenness in the warm season in 2000–19 in 11 534 urban areas. We used the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) to indicate greenness and a random forest model to predict daily temperatures in counterfactual EVI scenarios. In the factual EVI scenarios, daily mortality and weather variables from 830 locations in 53 countries were extracted from the Multi-Country Multi-City Collaborative Research Network and used to assess heat–mortality associations. These associations were then extrapolated to each urban area under both factual and counterfactual EVI scenarios based on meta-regression models. Findings: We estimated that EVI increased by 10% would decrease the global population-weighted warm-season mean temperature by 0·08°C, EVI increased by 20% would decrease temperature by 0.14C, and EVI increased by 30% would decrease temperature by 0.19C. In the factual scenario, 3 153 225 (2,48%) of 127 179 341 total deaths could be attributed to heat exposure. The attributable fraction of heat-related deaths (as a fraction of total deaths) in 2000–19 would decrease by 0.67 (95% empirical CI 0.53–0.82) percentage points in the 10% scenario, 0.80 (0.63–0.97) percentage points in the 20% scenario, and 0.91 (0.72–1.10) percentage points in the 30% scenario, compared with the factual scenario. South Europe was modelled to have the largest decrease in attributable fraction of heat-related mortality. Interpretation: This modelling study suggests that increased greenness could substantially reduce the heat-related mortality burden. Preserving and expanding greenness might be potential strategies to lower ambient temperature and reduce the health impacts of heat exposure. greenness heat mortality exposure modification\n\n\ngreenness, heat, mortality, exposure, modification"

In the factual EVI scenarios, daily mortality and weather variables from 830 locations in 53 countries were extracted from the Multi-Country Multi-City Collaborative Research Network and used to assess heat–mortality associations. These associations were then extrapolated to each urban area under both factual and counterfactual EVI scenarios based on meta-regression models. Findings: We estimated that EVI increased by 10% would decrease the global population-weighted warm-season mean temperature by 0·08°C, EVI increased by 20% would decrease temperature by 0.14C, and EVI increased by 30% would decrease temperature by 0.19C. In the factual scenario, 3 153 225 (2,48%) of 127 179 341 total deaths could be attributed to heat exposure. The attributable fraction of heat-related deaths (as a fraction of total deaths) in 2000–19 would decrease by 0.67 (95% empirical CI 0.53–0.82) percentage points in the 10% scenario, 0.80 (0.63–0.97) percentage points in the 20% scenario, and 0.91 (0.72–1.10) percentage points in the 30% scenario, compared with the factual scenario. South Europe was modelled to have the largest decrease in attributable fraction of heat-related mortality. Interpretation: This modelling study suggests that increased greenness could substantially reduce the heat-related mortality burden. Preserving and expanding greenness might be potential strategies to lower ambient temperature and reduce the health impacts of heat exposure. greenness heat mortality exposure modification\n\n\ngreenness, heat, mortality, exposure, modification"

The attributable fraction of heat-related deaths (as a fraction of total deaths) in 2000–19 would decrease by 0.67 (95% empirical CI 0.53–0.82) percentage points in the 10% scenario, 0.80 (0.63–0.97) percentage points in the 20% scenario, and 0.91 (0.72–1.10) percentage points in the 30% scenario, compared with the factual scenario.

This study aimed to comprehensively estimate the effects of increased greenness on heat-related deaths. Methods: We applied a multistage meta-analytical approach to estimate the potential reduction in global heat-related deaths by increasing greenness in the warm season in 2000–19 in 11 534 urban areas.

Findings: We estimated that EVI increased by 10% would decrease the global population-weighted warm-season mean temperature by 0·08°C, EVI increased by 20% would decrease temperature by 0.14C, and EVI increased by 30% would decrease temperature by 0.19C.

Heat and cold wave intensity and spatial extent on the Iberian Peninsula: future climate projections (2050–2095. https://doi.org/10.1007/s00382-025-07699-4 \n\n\nIn the current context of global warming, heat waves are extreme climate events that have captured the focused attention of the scientific community due to their increasing impact on public health, energy consumption, fire risk, and agriculture livestock. Although less studied, cold waves remain an extreme climate event to be reckoned with, with implications for transport systems, energy consumption, crops, and human health. This paper presents an analysis of the representative concentration pathway (RCP) 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios under European Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment simulations using the excess heat factor (EHF) and excess cold factor indices for the Iberian Peninsula and the Balearic Islands (IPB). The study period is the second half of the 21st Century (2050–2095) with respect to the historical reference period (1971–2000), and the dimensions analysed are intensity and spatial extent. The projected EHF results show a very significant increase on these dimensions. The average change in maximum heat wave intensity for the IPB is projected to be 144%, which is 40% more than in the 2021–2050 period. The largest changes are expected in the east and southeast and will reach 300%. The average spatial extent of heat waves is projected to increase by 1–2.7% per decade, significantly amplifying fire risk, energy demand, and human exposure. For cold waves, both dimensions will decrease. The average change in maximum cold wave intensity will be − 16%, and the maximum extent will decrease much more than the average, with decreases between − 0.7%/decade and − 3.2%/decade, which will imply lower exposure. Despite this, the RCP 8.5 scenario will record a higher maximum intensity of cold waves in the IPB than the RCP 4.5 scenario, demonstrating that such events will continue to exist in the second half of the century, even with high radiative forcing. climate change ecf ehf extreme temperatures future projections\n\n\nclimate changeecfehfextreme temperaturesfuture projections\n\n\n\n\n\nGaliano L, Monjo R, Royé D, Martin-Vide J (2025). Will the world experience more fractal droughts?. Atmospheric Research , vol. 316(1), art.  no. 107941. 10.1016/j.atmosres.2025.107941. \n\n\nMeteorological droughts will become the principal factor driving compound hot-dry events and analysis thereof is therefore fundamental with regard to understanding future climate patterns. The average citizen knows little of geometry, but it plays an essential role in the characteristics of the droughts, by means of “fractional lengths”. We analyzed the fractality of the meteorological droughts under the most recent climate change scenarios. A temporal fractality measure based upon the Cantor set reveals consensual changes in the behavior of droughts worldwide. Most regions will undergo a slight increase in fractality (up to +10 % on average), particularly associated with an acceleration of the hydrological cycle and the Hadley cell expansion, with a shift towards the higher latitudes of the tropical edge in both hemispheres. Geometrical measures were applied to the dry spells (1 mm) at a daily scale simulated by the SSP2–4.5 and SSP5–8.5 scenarios from 10 different Earth System Models of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6). The historical experiment was used as a baseline (1981–2010) and also compared to the ERA5 reanalysis. The results show an increasingly concentrated or uneven distribution of droughts in mid-latitudes towards the end of the century, becoming more intense the more pessimistic the scenario selected. Simultaneously, the polar regions might benefit from more regular precipitation patterns. Other inequality measures, such as the indices of Gini and Monjo, showed similar results. In general terms, the earth’s climate will be more fractal in the rainfall-related patterns, which likely means that the consequences will be more catastrophic for the human population. fractal droughts climate change precipitation patterns global dry spells\n\n\nfractal droughtsclimate changeprecipitation patternsglobaldry spells\n\n\n\n\n\nBatibeniz F, Seneviratne SI, Jha S, Ribeiro A, Suarez Gutierrez L, Raible CC, Malhotra A, Armstrong B, Bell ML, Lavigne E, Gasparrini A, Guo Y, Hashizume M, Masselot P, da Silva S, Royé D, Sera F, Tong S, Urban A, Vicedo-Cabrera AM (2025).

Scientific Reports , vol. 15, art.  no. 1002. 10.1038/s41598-024-82788-8. \n\n\nThe impacts of climate change on human health are often underestimated or perceived to be in a distant future. Here, we present the projected impacts of climate change in the context of COVID-19, a recent human health catastrophe. We compared projected heat mortality with COVID-19 deaths in 38 cities worldwide and found that in half of these cities, heat-related deaths could exceed annual COVID-19 deaths in less than ten years (at + 3.0 °C increase in global warming relative to preindustrial). In seven of these cities, heat mortality could exceed COVID-19 deaths in less than five years. Our results underscore the crucial need for climate action and for the integration of climate change into public health discourse and policy. climate action heat mortality covid-19 public health global warming\n\n\nclimate actionheat mortalitycovid-19public healthglobal warming\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2024\n\n\n\nXu R, Ye T, Huang W, Yue X, Morawska L, Abramson M, Chen G, Yu P, Liu Y, Yang Z, Zhang Y, Wu Y, Yu W, Wen B, Zhang Y, Hales S, Lavigne E, Saldiva P, Coelho M, Matus P, Royé D, Klompmaker J, Mistry M, Breitner S, Zeka A, Raz R, Tong S, Johnston F, Schwartz J, Gasparrini A, Guo Y, Li S (2024). Global, regional, and national mortality burden attributable to air pollution from landscape fires: a health impact assessment study. The Lancet , vol. 404(10470), pp. 2447-2459.  10.1016/S0140-6736(24)02251-7. \n\n\nBackground: Landscape fire-sourced (LFS) air pollution is an increasing public health concern in the context of climate change. However, little is known about the attributable global, regional, and national mortality burden related to LFS air pollution. Methods: We calculated country-specific population-weighted average daily and annual LFS fine particulate matter (PM2·5) and surface ozone (O3) during 2000-19 from a validated dataset. We obtained the relative risks (RRs) for both short-term and long-term impact of LFS PM2·5 and O3 on all-cause, cardiovascular, and respiratory mortality. The short-term RRs were pooled from community-specific standard time-series regressions in 2267 communities across 59 countries or territories. The long-term RRs were obtained from published meta-analyses of cohort studies on all-source PM2·5 and O3. Annual mortality, population, and socio-demographic data for each country or territory were extracted from the Global Burden of Diseases Study 2019. These data were used to estimate country-specific annual deaths attributable to LFS air pollution using standard algorithms. Findings: Globally, 1·53 million all-cause deaths per year (95% empirical confidence interval [eCI] 1·24-1·82) were attributable to LFS air pollution during 2000-19, including 0·45 million (0·32-0·57) cardiovascular deaths and 0·22 million respiratory deaths (0·08-0·35). LFS PM2·5 and O3 contributed to 77·6% and 22·4% of the total attributable deaths, respectively. Over 90% of all attributable deaths were in low-income and middle-income countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa (606 769 deaths per year), southeast Asia (206 817 deaths), south Asia (170 762 deaths), and east Asia (147 291 deaths). The global cardiovascular attributable deaths saw an average 1·67% increase per year (ptrend 0·001), although the trends for all-cause and respiratory attributable deaths were not statistically significant. The five countries with the largest all-cause attributable deaths were China, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, India, Indonesia, and Nigeria, although the order changed in the second decade. The leading countries with the greatest attributable mortality rates (AMRs) were all in sub-Saharan Africa, despite decreasing trends from 2000 to 2019. North and central America, and countries surrounding the Mediterranean, showed increasing trends of all-cause, cardiovascular, and respiratory AMRs. Increasing cardiovascular AMR was also observed in southeast Asia, south Asia, and east Asia. In 2019, the AMRs in low-income countries remained four times those in high-income countries, though this had reduced from nine times in 2000. AMRs negatively correlated with a country-specific socio-demographic index (Spearman correlation coefficients r around -0·60). Interpretation: LFS air pollution induced a substantial global mortality burden, with notable geographical and socioeconomic disparities. Urgent actions are required to address such substantial health impact and the associated environmental injustice in a warming climate. air pollution landscape fires mortality burden health impact global assessment\n\n\nair pollutionlandscape firesmortality burdenhealth impactglobal assessment\n\n\n\n\n\nCarbone J, Sanchez B, Román-Cascón C, Martilli A, Royé D, Yagüe C (2024). Effects of the urban development on the nearsurface air temperature and surface energy balance: The case study of Madrid from 1970 to 2020. Urban Climate , vol. 58, art.  no. 102198. 10.1016/j.uclim.2024.102198. \n\n\nThe aim of the present study is to examine the impact of Madrid’s urban growth over the last 50 years (1970–2020). We conduct a modelling study using WRF-ARW with the multilayer urban parameterization BEP-BEM, in which different urban parameters have been incorporated at each point within the model’s inner domain according to urban expansion from 1970 to 2020. Two scenarios of important societal interest with different meteorological conditions are selected for this study: a period of intense heatwave during the summer season and a short period of strongly stable atmospheric conditions in winter, both in 2020. The results show that in areas where the urban fraction becomes greater an increase in near-surface air temperature is found for both simulated periods, especially during the night. The urbanization modifies the surface energy balance and turbulent transport in Madrid and its surroundings. It leads to a decrease in latent heat flux due to the high impermeability and reduced vegetation in urban areas. Additionally, the urban areas with a higher density of buildings have a high heat capacity, increasing heat flux storage during the day through solar radiation absorption. This stored energy is released at night, exacerbating the increase in nighttime near-surface air temperature in both periods. urban climate urban growth near-surface air temperatures surface energy balance turbulence heatwave stable atmospheric conditions madrid\n\n\nurban climateurban growthnear-surface air temperaturessurface energy balanceturbulenceheatwavestable atmospheric conditionsmadrid\n\n\n\n\n\nFeurer D, Riffe T, Kniffka M, Acosta E, Armstrong B, Mistry M, Lowe R, Royé D, Hashizume M, Madaniyazi L, Ng C, Tobias A, Íñiguez C, Vicedo-Cabrera A, Ragettli M, Lavigne E, Correa P, Ortega N, Kyselý J, Urban A, Orru H, Indermitte E, Maasikmets M, Dallavalle M, Schneider A, Honda Y, Alahmad B, Zanobetti A, Schwartz J, Carrasco G, Holobâca I, Kim H, Lee W, Bell M, Scovronick N, Acquaotta F, Coélho M, Diaz M, Arellano E, Michelozzi P, Stafoggia M, de’Donato F, Rao S, Di Ruscio F, Seposo X, Guo Y, Tong S, Masselot P, Gasparrini A, Sera F (2024). Meteorological factors, population immunity, and COVID19 incidence: A global multicity analysis. Environmental Epidemiology , vol. 8(6), art.  no. e338. 10.1097/ee9.0000000000000338. \n\n\nObjectives: While COVID-19 continues to challenge the world, meteorological variables are thought to impact COVID-19 transmission. Previous studies showed evidence of negative associations between high temperature and absolute humidity on COVID-19 transmission. Our research aims to fill the knowledge gap on the modifying effect of vaccination rates and strains on the weather-COVID-19 association. Methods: Our study included COVID-19 data from 439 cities in 22 countries spanning 3 February 2020 - 31 August 2022 and meteorological variables (temperature, relative humidity, absolute humidity, solar radiation, and precipitation). We used a two-stage time-series design to assess the association between meteorological factors and COVID-19 incidence. For the exposure modeling, we used distributed lag nonlinear models with a lag of up to 14 days. Finally, we pooled the estimates using a random effect meta-analytic model and tested vaccination rates and dominant strains as possible effect modifiers. Results: Our results showed an association between temperature and absolute humidity on COVID-19 transmission. At 5 °C, the relative risk of COVID-19 incidence is 1.22-fold higher compared to a reference level at 17 °C. Correlated with temperature, we observed an inverse association for absolute humidity. We observed a tendency of increased risk on days without precipitation, but no association for relative humidity and solar radiation. No interaction between vaccination rates or strains on the weather-COVID-19 association was observed. Conclusions: This study strengthens previous evidence of a relationship of temperature and absolute humidity with COVID-19 incidence. Furthermore, no evidence was found that vaccinations and strains significantly modify the relationship between environmental factors and COVID-19 transmission. covid-19 distributed lag nonlinear models humidity multi-country multi-city collaborative research network precipitation solar radiation temperature time-series design\n\n\ncovid-19distributed lag nonlinear modelshumiditymulti-country multi-city collaborative research networkprecipitationsolar radiationtemperaturetime-series design\n\n\n\n\n\nLee W, Kang C, Park C, Bell M, Armstrong B, Royé D, Hashizume M, Gasparrini A, Tobias A, Sera F, Honda Y, Urban A, Kyselý J, Íñiguez C, Ryti N, Guo Y, Tong S, de Sousa Zanotti Stagliorio Coelho M, Lavigne E, de’Donato F, Guo Y, Schwartz J, Schneider A, Breitner S, Chung Y, Kim S, Ha E, Kim H, Kim Y (2024). Association of holidays and the day of the week with suicide risk: multicountry, two stage, time series study. BMJ , vol. 387, art.  no. e077262. 10.1136/bmj-2024-077262. \n\n\nObjectives To assess the short term temporal variations in suicide risk related to the day of the week and national holidays in multiple countries. Design Multicountry, two stage, time series design. Setting Data from 740 locations in 26 countries and territories, with overlapping periods between 1971 and 2019, collected from the Multi-city Multi-country Collaborative Research Network database. Participants All suicides were registered in these locations during the study period (overall 1 701  286 cases). Main outcome measures Daily suicide mortality. Results Mondays had peak suicide risk during weekdays (Monday-Friday) across all countries, with relative risks (reference: Wednesday) ranging from 1.02 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.95 to 1.10) in Costa Rica to 1.17 (1.09 to 1.25) in Chile. Suicide risks were lowest on Saturdays or Sundays in many countries in North America, Asia, and Europe. However, the risk increased during weekends in South and Central American countries, Finland, and South Africa. Additionally, evidence suggested strong increases in suicide risk on New Year’s day in most countries with relative risks ranging from 0.93 (95% CI 0.75 to 1.14) in Japan to 1.93 (1.31 to 2.85) in Chile, whereas the evidence on Christmas day was weak. Suicide risk was associated with a weak decrease on other national holidays, except for Central and South American countries, where the risk generally increased one or two days after these holidays. Conclusions Suicide risk was highest on Mondays and increased on New Year’s day in most countries. However, the risk of suicide on weekends and Christmas varied by country and territory. The results of this study can help to better understand the short term variations in suicide risks and define suicide prevention action plans and awareness campaigns. suicide risk holidays day of the week time series analysis multicountry study\n\n\nsuicide riskholidaysday of the weektime series analysismulticountry study\n\n\n\n\n\nOrlov A, De Hertog S, Havermann F, Guo S, Manola I, Lejeune Q, Schleussner C, Thiery W, Pongratz J, Humpenöder F, Popp A, Aunan K, Armstrong B, Royé D, Cvijanovic I, Lavigne E, Achilleos S, Bell M, Masselot P, Sera F, Vicedo-Cabrera A, Gasparrini A, Mistry M (2024). Impacts of landuse and landcover changes on temperature related mortality. Environmental Epidemiology , vol. 8(6), art.  no. e337. 10.1097/ee9.0000000000000337. \n\n\nBackground: Land-use and land-cover change (LULCC) can substantially affect climate through biogeochemical and biogeophysical effects. Here, we examine the future temperature–mortality impact for two contrasting LULCC scenarios in a background climate of low greenhouse gas concentrations. The first LULCC scenario implies a globally sustainable land use and socioeconomic development (sustainability). In the second LULCC scenario, sustainability is implemented only in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development countries (inequality). Methods: Using the Multi-Country Multi-City (MCC) dataset on mortality from 823 locations in 52 countries and territories, we estimated the temperature–mortality exposure–response functions (ERFs). The LULCC and noLULCC scenarios were implemented in three fully coupled Earth system models (ESMs): Community Earth System Model, Max Planck Institute Earth System Model, and European Consortium Earth System Model. Next, using temperature from the ESMs’ simulations and the estimated location-specific ERFs, we assessed the temperature-related impact on mortality for the LULCC and noLULCC scenarios around the mid and end century. Results: Under sustainability, the multimodel mean changes in excess mortality range from −1.1 to +0.6 percentage points by 2050–2059 across all locations and from −1.4 to +0.5 percentage points by 2090–2099. Under inequality, these vary from −0.7 to +0.9 percentage points by 2050–2059 and from −1.3 to +2 percentage points by 2090–2099. Conclusions: While an unequal socioeconomic development and unsustainable land use could increase the burden of heat-related mortality in most regions, globally sustainable land use has the potential to reduce it in some locations. However, the total (cold and heat) impact on mortality is very location specific and strongly depends on the underlying climate change scenario due to nonlinearity in the temperature–mortality relationship. land-use change temperature-related mortality climate impact biogeophysical effects health assessment\n\n\nland-use changetemperature-related mortalityclimate impactbiogeophysical effectshealth assessment\n\n\n\n\n\nTobías A, Íñiguez C, Hurtado Díaz M, Riojas H, Cifuentes L, Royé D, Abrutzky R, Coelho M, Saldiva P, Valdés Ortega N, Matus Correa P, Osorio S, Carrasco G, Colistro V, Pascal M, Chanel O, Madaniyazi L, Gasparrini A (2024). Mortality burden and economic loss attributable to cold and heat in Central and South America. Environmental Epidemiology , vol. 8(6), art.  no. e335. 10.1097/ee9.0000000000000335. \n\n\nBackground: We quantify the mortality burden and economic loss attributable to nonoptimal temperatures for cold and heat in the Central and South American countries in the Multi-City Multi-Country (MCC) Collaborative Research Network. Methods: We collected data for 66 locations from 13 countries in Central and South America to estimate location-specific temperature–mortality associations using time-series regression with distributed lag nonlinear models. We calculated the attributable deaths for cold and heat as the 2.5th and 97.5th temperature percentiles, above and below the minimum mortality temperature, and used the value of a life year to estimate the economic loss of delayed deaths. Results: The mortality impact of cold varied widely by country, from 9.64% in Uruguay to 0.22% in Costa Rica. The heat-attributable fraction for mortality ranged from 1.41% in Paraguay to 0.01% in Ecuador. Locations in arid and temperate climatic zones showed higher cold-related mortality (5.10% and 5.29%, respectively) than those in tropical climates (1.71%). Arid and temperate climatic zones saw lower heat-attributable fractions (0.69% and 0.58%) than arid climatic zones (0.92%). Exposure to cold led to an annual economic loss of 0.6 million in Costa Rica to 472.2 million in Argentina. In comparison, heat resulted in economic losses of 0.05 million in Ecuador to 90.6 million in Brazil. Conclusion: Most of the mortality burden for Central and South American countries is caused by cold compared to heat, generating annual economic losses of 2.1 billion and 290.7 million, respectively. Public health policies and adaptation measures in the region should account for the health effects associated with nonoptimal temperatures. mortality burden economic loss cold and heat central and south america nonoptimal temperatures\n\n\nmortality burdeneconomic losscold and heatcentral and south americanonoptimal temperatures\n\n\n\n\n\nHe C, Breitner-Busch S, Huber V, Chen K, Zhang S, Gasparrini A, Bell M, Kan H, Royé D, Armstrong B, Schwartz J, Sera F, Vicedo-Cabrera A, Honda Y, Jaakkola J, Ryti N, Kyselý J, Guo Y, Tong S, de’Donato F, Michelozzi P, Coelho M, Saldiva P, Lavigne E, Orru H, Indermitte E, Pascal M, Goodman P, Zeka A, Kim Y, Diaz M, Arellano E, Overcenco A, Klompmaker J, Rao S, Palomares A, Carrasco G, Seposo X, Pereira da Silva S, Madureira J, Holobaca I, Scovronick N, Acquaotta F, Kim H, Lee W, Hashizume M, Tobias A, Íñiguez C, Forsberg B, Ragettli M, Guo Y, Pan S, Osorio S, Li S, Zanobetti A, Dang T, Van Dung D, Schneider A (2024). Rainfall events and daily mortality across 645 global locations: two stage time series analysis. BMJ , vol. 387, art.  no. e080944. 10.1136/bmj2024080944. \n\n\nObjective To examine the associations between characteristics of daily rainfall (intensity, duration, and frequency) and all cause, cardiovascular, and respiratory mortality. Design Two stage time series analysis.Setting 645 locations across 34 countries or regions. Population Daily mortality data, comprising a total of 109954744 all cause, 31164161 cardiovascular, and 11817278 respiratory deaths from 1980 to 2020. Main outcome measure Association between daily mortality and rainfall events with return periods (the expected average time between occurrences of an extreme event of a certain magnitude) of one year, two years, and five years, with a 14 day lag period. A continuous relative intensity index was used to generate intensity-response curves to estimate mortality risks at a global scale. Results During the study period, a total of 50 913 rainfall events with a one year return period, 8362 events with a two year return period, and 3301 events with a five year return period were identified. A day of extreme rainfall with a five year return period was significantly associated with increased daily all cause, cardiovascular, and respiratory mortality, with cumulative relative risks across 0-14 lag days of 1.08 (95% confidence interval 1.05 to 1.11), 1.05 (1.02 to 1.08), and 1.29 (1.19 to 1.39), respectively. Rainfall events with a two year return period were associated with respiratory mortality only, whereas no significant associations were found for events with a one year return period. Non-linear analysis revealed protective effects (relative risk 1) with moderate-heavy rainfall events, shifting to adverse effects (relative risk 1) with extreme intensities. Additionally, mortality risks from extreme rainfall events appeared to be modified by climate type, baseline variability in rainfall, and vegetation coverage, whereas the moderating effects of population density and income level were not significant. Locations with lower variability of baseline rainfall or scarce vegetation coverage showed higher risks. Conclusion Daily rainfall intensity is associated with varying health effects, with extreme events linked to an increasing relative risk for all cause, cardiovascular, and respiratory mortality. The observed associations varied with local climate and urban infrastructure. rainfall events daily mortality time series analysis global study cardiovascular and respiratory mortality\n\n\nrainfall eventsdaily mortalitytime series analysisglobal studycardiovascular and respiratory mortality\n\n\n\n\n\nAlvarez I, Diaz-Poso A, Lorenzo MN, Royé D (2024). Heat index historical trends and projections due to climate change in the Mediterranean basin based on CMIP6. Atmospheric Research , vol. 308, art.  no. 107512. 10.1016/j.atmosres.2024.107512. \n\n\nAir temperature and relative humidity can be considered as two essential meteorological parameters in the determination of heat stress. The heat index (HI) includes both of them and it is appropriate for determining the thermal conditions of different climates. We investigated potential changes in the HI for the Mediterranean basin using simulations from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) climate models under two future scenarios (Shared Socio-economic Pathways: SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5) over the period 2020–2099. Results reveal an important increase of HI at the end of the 21st century for both scenarios, with greater changes for the SSP5-8.5 scenario all over the basin. Strong significant upwards trends (around 1 °C per decade; significance level computed at 5%) are expected in the entire area and for all months at the end of the century, with greatest values during the summer months (close to 1.5 °C per decade) along the coastal areas of the basin. Many areas of the Southern Mediterranean basin (Africa and Arabian Peninsula) will be strongly affected with dangerously high heat index values (higher than 41 °C) during summer months by the end of the 21st century. A northward extension of these dangerous conditions is also expected including several areas of southern Europe. heat index heat risk mediterranean arabian peninsula africa cmip6\n\n\nheat indexheat riskmediterraneanarabian peninsulaafricacmip6\n\n\n\n\n\nYang D, Hashizume M, Tobías A, Honda Y, Royé D, Oh J, Dang T, Kim Y, Abrutzky R, Guo Y, Tong S, Coelho M, Saldiva P, Lavigne E, Correa P, Ortega N, Osorio S, Kyselý J, Urban A, Orru H, Indermitte E, Jaakkola J, Ryti N, Pascal M, Huber V, Schneider A, Katsouyanni K, Analitis A, Entezari A, Mayvaneh F, Goodman P, Zeka A, Michelozzi P, de’Donato F, Alahmad B, Diaz M, la Cruz Valencia C, Overcenco A, Houthuijs D, Ameling C, Rao S, Nunes B, Madureira J, Holo-bâc I, Scovronick N, Acquaotta F, Kim H, Lee W, Íñiguez C, Forsberg B, Vicedo-Cabrera A, Ragettli M, Guo Y, Pan S, Li S, Sera F, Zanobetti A, Schwartz J, Armstrong B, Gasparrini A, Chung Y (2024). Temporal change in minimum mortality temperature under changing climate: A multicountry multicommunity observational study spanning 1986–2015. Environmental Epidemiology , vol. 8(5), art.  no. e334. 10.1097/ee9.0000000000000334. \n\n\nBackground: The minimum mortality temperature (MMT) or MMT percentile (MMTP) is an indicator of population susceptibility to nonoptimum temperatures. MMT and MMTP change over time; however, the changing directions show region-wide heterogeneity. We examined the heterogeneity of temporal changes in MMT and MMTP across multiple communities and in multiple countries. Methods: Daily time-series data for mortality and ambient mean temperature for 699 communities in 34 countries spanning 1986–2015 were analyzed using a two-stage meta-analysis. First, a quasi-Poisson regression was employed to estimate MMT and MMTP for each community during the designated subperiods. Second, we pooled the community-specific temporally varying estimates using mixed-effects meta-regressions to examine temporal changes in MMT and MMTP in the entire study population, as well as by climate zone, geographical region, and country. Results: Temporal increases in MMT and MMTP from 19.5C (17.9, 21.1) to 20.3C (18.5, 22.0) and from the 74.5 (68.3, 80.6) to 75.0 (71.0, 78.9) percentiles in the entire population were found, respectively. Temporal change was significantly heterogeneous across geographical regions (P 0.001). Temporal increases in MMT were observed in East Asia (linear slope [LS] = 0.91, P = 0.02) and South-East Asia (LS = 0.62, P = 0.05), whereas a temporal decrease in MMT was observed in South Europe (LS = −0.46, P = 0.05). MMTP decreased temporally in North Europe (LS = −3.45, P = 0.02) and South Europe (LS = −2.86, P = 0.05). Conclusions: The temporal change in MMT or MMTP was largely heterogeneous. Population susceptibility in terms of optimum temperature may have changed under a warming climate, albeit with large region-dependent variations. minimum mortality temperature climate change temporal change multicountry study observational analysis\n\n\nminimum mortality temperatureclimate changetemporal changemulticountry studyobservational analysis\n\n\n\n\n\nScovronick N, Sera F, Vu B, Vicedo-Cabrera A, Royé D, Tobias A, Seposo X, Forsberg B, Guo Y, Li S, Honda Y, Abrutzky R, de Sousa Zanotti Stagliorio Coelho M, Nascimento Saldiva P, Lavigne E, Kan H, Osorio S, Kyselý J, Urban A, Orru H, Indermitte E, Jaakkola J, Ryti N, Pascal M, Katsouyanni K, Mayvaneh F, Entezari A, Goodman P, Zeka A, Michelozzi P, de’Donato F, Hashizume M, Alahmad B, Zanobetti A, Schwartz J, Hurtado Diaz M, De La Cruz Valencia C, Rao S, Madureira J, Acquaotta F, Kim H, Lee W, Iniguez C, Ragettli M, Guo Y, Dang T, Dung D, Armstrong B, Gasparrini A (2024). Temperature mortality associations by age and cause: a multicountry multicity study. Environmental Epidemiology , vol. 8(5), art.  no. e336. 10.1097/ee9.0000000000000336. \n\n\nBackground: Heterogeneity in temperature-mortality relationships across locations may partly result from differences in the demographic structure of populations and their cause-specific vulnerabilities. Here we conduct the largest epidemiological study to date on the association between ambient temperature and mortality by age and cause using data from 532 cities in 33 countries. Methods: We collected daily temperature and mortality data from each country. Mortality data was provided as daily death counts within age groups from all, cardiovascular, respiratory, or noncardiorespiratory causes. We first fit quasi-Poisson regression models to estimate location-specific associations for each age-by-cause group. For each cause, we then pooled location-specific results in a dose-response multivariate meta-regression model that enabled us to estimate overall temperature-mortality curves at any age. The age analysis was limited to adults. Results: We observed high temperature effects on mortality from both cardiovascular and respiratory causes compared to noncardiorespiratory causes, with the highest cold-related risks from cardiovascular causes and the highest heat-related risks from respiratory causes. Risks generally increased with age, a pattern most consistent for cold and for nonrespiratory causes. For every cause group, risks at both temperature extremes were strongest at the oldest age (age 85 years). Excess mortality fractions were highest for cold at the oldest ages. Conclusions: There is a differential pattern of risk associated with heat and cold by cause and age; cardiorespiratory causes show stronger effects than noncardiorespiratory causes, and older adults have higher risks than younger adults. temperature-mortality associations age-specific mortality cause-specific mortality multi-country study multi-city analysis\n\n\ntemperature-mortality associationsage-specific mortalitycause-specific mortalitymulti-country studymulti-city analysis\n\n\n\n\n\nGuo Q, Mistry M, Zhou X, Zhao G, Kino K, Wen B, Yoshimura K, Satoh Y, Cvijanovic I, Kim Y, Ng C, Vicedo-Cabrera A, Armstrong B, Urban A, Katsouyanni K, Masselot P, Tong S, Sera F, Huber V, Bell M, Kyselý J, Gasparrini A, Hashizume M, Oki T, Abrutzky R, Guo Y, de Sousa Zanotti Stagliorio Coelho M, Nascimento Saldiva P, Lavigne E, Ortega N, Correa P, Kan H, Osorio S, Royé D, Indermitte E, Orru H, Jaakkola J, Ryti N, Pascal M, Schneider A, Analitis A, Entezari A, Mayvaneh F, Zeka A, Goodman P, de’Donato F, Michelozzi P, Alahmad B, De la Cruz Valencia C, Hurtado Diaz M, Overcenco A, Ameling C, Houthuijs D, Rao S, Carrasco G, Seposo X, Madureira J, das Neves Pereira da Silva S, Holobaca I, Acquaotta F, Scovronick N, Kim H, Lee W, Tobias A, Íñiguez C, Forsberg B, Ragettli M, Pan S, Guo Y, Li S, Schneider R, Colistro V, Zanobetti A, Schwartz J, Van Dung D, Ngoc Dang T, Honda Y (2024). Regional variation in the role of humidity on citylevel heatrelated mortality. PNAS Nexus , vol. 3(8), art.  no. pgae290. 10.1093/pnasnexus/pgae290. \n\n\nThe rising humid heat is regarded as a severe threat to human survivability, but the proper integration of humid heat into heat-health alerts is still being explored. Using state-of-the-art epidemiological and climatological datasets, we examined the association between multiple heat stress indicators (HSIs) and daily human mortality in 739 cities worldwide. Notable differences were observed in the long-term trends and timing of heat events detected by HSIs. Air temperature (Tair) predicts heat-related mortality well in cities with a robust negative Tair-relative humidity correlation (CT-RH). However, in cities with near-zero or weak positive CT-RH, HSIs considering humidity provide enhanced predictive power compared to Tair. Furthermore, the magnitude and timing of heat-related mortality measured by HSIs could differ largely from those associated with Tair in many cities. Our findings provide important insights into specific regions where humans are vulnerable to humid heat and can facilitate the further enhancement of heat-health alert systems. humidity heat-related mortality city-level analysis regional variation heat stress indicators\n\n\nhumidityheat-related mortalitycity-level analysisregional variationheat stress indicators\n\n\n\n\n\nChua P, Tobias A, Madaniyazi L, Ng C, Phung V, Fu S, Rodriguez P, Brown P, Coelho M, Saldiva P, Scovronick N, Deshpande A, Salazar M, Dorotan M, Tantrakarnapa K, Kliengchuay W, Abrutzky R, Carrasco-Escobar G, Royé D, Hales S, Hashizume M (2024). Association between precipitation and mortality due to diarrheal diseases by climate zone: A multicountry modeling study. Environmental Epidemiology , vol. 8(4), art.  no. e320. 10.1097/ee9.0000000000000320. \n\n\nBackground: Precipitation could affect the transmission of diarrheal diseases. The diverse precipitation patterns across different climates might influence the degree of diarrheal risk from precipitation. This study determined the associations between precipitation and diarrheal mortality in tropical, temperate, and arid climate regions. Methods: Daily counts of diarrheal mortality and 28-day cumulative precipitation from 1997 to 2019 were analyzed across 29 locations in eight middle-income countries (Argentina, Brazil, Costa Rica, India, Peru, the Philippines, South Africa, and Thailand). A two-stage approach was employed: the first stage is conditional Poisson regression models for each location, and the second stage is meta-analysis for pooling location-specific coefficients by climate zone. Results: In tropical climates, higher precipitation increases the risk of diarrheal mortality. Under extremely wet conditions (95th percentile of 28-day cumulative precipitation), diarrheal mortality increased by 17.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 10.4%, 25.7%) compared with minimum-risk precipitation. For temperate and arid climates, diarrheal mortality increases in both dry and wet conditions. In extremely dry conditions (fifth percentile of 28-day cumulative precipitation), diarrheal mortality risk increases by 3.8% (95% CI = 1.2%, 6.5%) for temperate and 5.5% (95% CI = 1.0%, 10.2%) for arid climates. Similarly, under extremely wet conditions, diarrheal mortality risk increases by 2.5% (95% CI = −0.1%, 5.1%) for temperate and 4.1% (95% CI = 1.1%, 7.3%) for arid climates. Conclusions: Associations between precipitation and diarrheal mortality exhibit variations across different climate zones. It is crucial to consider climate-specific variations when generating global projections of future precipitation-related diarrheal mortality. precipitation diarrheal diseases climate zones mortality multi-country modeling\n\n\nprecipitationdiarrheal diseasesclimate zonesmortalitymulti-country modeling\n\n\n\n\n\nChen G, Guo Y, Yue X, Xu R, Yu W, Ye T, Tong S, Gasparrini A, Bell M, Armstrong B, Schwartz J, Jaakkola J, Lavigne E, Saldiva P, Kan H, Royé D, Urban A, Vicedo-Cabrera A, Tobias A, Forsberg B, Sera F, Lei Y, Abramson M, Li S, Abrutzky R, Alahmad B, Ameling C, Åström C, Breitner S, Carrasco-Escobar G, Coêlho M, Colistro V, Correa P, Dang T, de’Donato F, Dung D, Entezari A, Garcia S, Garland R, Goodman P, Guo Y, Hashizume M, Holobaca I, Honda Y, Houthuijs D, Hurtado-Díaz M, Íñiguez C, Katsouyanni K, Kim H, Kyselý J, Lee W, Maasikmets M, Madureira J, Mayvaneh F, Nunes B, Orru H, Ortega N, Overcenco A, Pan S, Pascal M, Ragettli M, Rao S, Ryti N, Samoli E, Schneider A, Scovronick N, Seposo X, Stafoggia M, Valencia C, Zanobetti A, Zeka A (2024). Allcause, cardiovascular, and respiratory mortality and wildfirerelated ozone: a multicountry twostage time series analysis. The Lancet Planetary Health , vol. 8(7), pp. e452-e462.  10.1016/S2542-5196(24)00117-7. \n\n\nBackground. Wildfire activity is an important source of tropospheric ozone (O3) pollution. However, no study to date has systematically examined the associations of wildfire-related O3 exposure with mortality globally. Methods. We did a multicountry two-stage time series analysis. From the Multi-City Multi-Country (MCC) Collaborative Research Network, data on daily all-cause, cardiovascular, and respiratory deaths were obtained from 749 locations in 43 countries or areas, representing overlapping periods from Jan 1, 2000, to Dec 31, 2016. We estimated the daily concentration of wildfire-related O3 in study locations using a chemical transport model, and then calibrated and downscaled O3 estimates to a resolution of 0·25° × 0·25° (approximately 28 km2 at the equator). Using a random-effects meta-analysis, we examined the associations of short-term wildfire-related O3 exposure (lag period of 0–2 days) with daily mortality, first at the location level and then pooled at the country, regional, and global levels. Annual excess mortality fraction in each location attributable to wildfire-related O3 was calculated with pooled effect estimates and used to obtain excess mortality fractions at country, regional, and global levels. Findings. Between 2000 and 2016, the highest maximum daily wildfire-related O3 concentrations (≥30 μg/m3) were observed in locations in South America, central America, and southeastern Asia, and the country of South Africa. Across all locations, an increase of 1 μg/m3 in the mean daily concentration of wildfire-related O3 during lag 0–2 days was associated with increases of 0·55% (95% CI 0·29 to 0·80) in daily all-cause mortality, 0·44% (–0·10 to 0·99) in daily cardiovascular mortality, and 0·82% (0·18 to 1·47) in daily respiratory mortality. The associations of daily mortality rates with wildfire-related O3 exposure showed substantial geographical heterogeneity at the country and regional levels. Across all locations, estimated annual excess mortality fractions of 0·58% (95% CI 0·31 to 0·85; 31 606 deaths [95% CI 17 038 to 46 027]) for all-cause mortality, 0·41% (–0·10 to 0·91; 5249 [–1244 to 11 620]) for cardiovascular mortality, and 0·86% (0·18 to 1·51; 4657 [999 to 8206]) for respiratory mortality were attributable to short-term exposure to wildfire-related O3. Interpretation. In this study, we observed an increase in all-cause and respiratory mortality associated with short-term wildfire-related O3 exposure. Effective risk and smoke management strategies should be implemented to protect the public from the impacts of wildfires. wildfire-related ozone all-cause mortality cardiovascular mortality respiratory mortality two-stage time series\n\n\nwildfire-related ozoneall-cause mortalitycardiovascular mortalityrespiratory mortalitytwo-stage time series\n\n\n\n\n\nLemus-Canovas M, Montesinos-Ciuró E, Cearreta-Innocenti T, Serrano-Notivoli R, Royé D (2024). Attribution of the unprecedented heat event of August 2023 in Barcelona (Spain) to observed and projected global warming. Urban Climate , vol. 56, art.  no. 102019. 10.1016/j.uclim.2024.102019. \n\n\nThe study analyses observed and numerical simulations of daily maximum and minimum temperature from 1920 onwards and to investigate the unprecedented heat event that occurred in 21–23 August 2023 in Barcelona. The historical changes in the intensity of such events, their expected future changes under scenarios of +1.5 °C, +2 °C, and + 3 °C, and the future exposure of populations to such kind of events are examined using the flow analogues approach. The findings indicate a significant increase in observed temperatures for similar heatwaves to those occurred in August 2023. The study also emphasises the impact of global warming on the intensification of heat events over the impact of urbanization. Additionally, after examining the role of natural variability in temperature changes, we concluded that global warming is the primary factor driving the increase in heatwave intensity. In terms of the frequency of such events, we found that extreme heat events, such as the August 2023 heatwave, will become 2 and 5 times more likely with a global summer warming of 2 °C and 3 °C, respectively. This will expose a large portion of the population to dangerous heat levels highlighting the importance of limiting global warming to 1.5 °C to mitigate the impacts on urban populations. extreme event attribution heatwave urban climate global warming barcelona\n\n\nextreme event attributionheatwaveurban climateglobal warmingbarcelona\n\n\n\n\n\nAlahmad B, Khraishah H, Kamineni M, Royé D, Papatheodorou S, Vicedo-Cabrera A, Guo Y, Lavigne E, Armstrong B, Sera F, Bernstein A, Zanobetti A, Garshick E, Schwartz J, Bell M, Al-Mulla F, Koutrakis P, Gasparrini A, Souzana A, Acquaotta F, Pan S, Sousa Zanotti Stagliorio Coelho M, Colistro V, Ngoc Dang T, Van Dung D, De’ Donato F, Entezari A, Leon Guo Y, Hashizume M, Honda Y, Indermitte E, Íñiguez C, Jaakkola J, Kim H, Lee W, Li S, Madureira J, Mayvaneh F, Orru H, Overcenco A, Ragettli M, Ryti N, Hilario Nascimento Saldiva P, Scovronick N, Seposo X, Pereira Silva S, Stafoggia M, Tobias A (2024). Extreme Temperatures and Stroke Mortality: Evidence From a MultiCountry Analysis. Stroke , vol. 55(7), pp. 1847-1856.  10.1161/strokeaha.123.045751. \n\n\nBackground: Extreme temperatures contribute significantly to global mortality. While previous studies on temperature and stroke-specific outcomes presented conflicting results, these studies were predominantly limited to single-city or single-country analyses. Their findings are difficult to synthesize due to variations in methodologies and exposure definitions. Methods: Within the Multi-Country Multi-City Network, we built a new mortality database for ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. Applying a unified analysis protocol, we conducted a multinational case-crossover study on the relationship between extreme temperatures and stroke. In the first stage, we fitted a conditional quasi-Poisson regression for daily mortality counts with distributed lag nonlinear models for temperature exposure separately for each city. In the second stage, the cumulative risk from each city was pooled using mixed-effect meta-analyses, accounting for clustering of cities with similar features. We compared temperature-stroke associations across country-level gross domestic product per capita. We computed excess deaths in each city that are attributable to the 2.5% hottest and coldest of days based on each city’s temperature distribution. Results: We collected data for a total of 3 443 969 ischemic strokes and 2 454 267 hemorrhagic stroke deaths from 522 cities in 25 countries. For every 1000 ischemic stroke deaths, we found that extreme cold and hot days contributed 9.1 (95% empirical CI, 8.6–9.4) and 2.2 (95% empirical CI, 1.9–2.4) excess deaths, respectively. For every 1000 hemorrhagic stroke deaths, extreme cold and hot days contributed 11.2 (95% empirical CI, 10.9–11.4) and 0.7 (95% empirical CI, 0.5–0.8) excess deaths, respectively. We found that countries with low gross domestic product per capita were at higher risk of heat-related hemorrhagic stroke mortality than countries with high gross domestic product per capita (P=0.02). Conclusions: Both extreme cold and hot temperatures are associated with an increased risk of dying from ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes. As climate change continues to exacerbate these extreme temperatures, interventional strategies are needed to mitigate impacts on stroke mortality, particularly in low-income countries. extreme temperatures stroke mortality ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke multi-country analysis climate impact\n\n\nextreme temperaturesstroke mortalityischemic and hemorrhagic strokemulti-country analysisclimate impact\n\n\n\n\n\nHundessa S, Huang W, Zhao Q, Wu Y, Wen B, Alahmad B, Armstrong B, Gasparrini A, Sera F, Tong S, Madureira J, Kyselý J, Schwartz J, Vicedo-Cabrera A, Hales S, Johnson A, Li S, Guo Y, Jaakkola J, Ryti N, Urban A, Tobias A, Royé D, Lavigne E, Ragettli M, Åström C, Raz R, Pascal M, Kan H, Goodman P, Zeka A, Hashizume M, Diaz M, Seposo X, Nunes B, Kim H, Lee W, Íñiguez C, Guo Y, Pan S, Zanobetti A, Dang T, Van Dung D, Schneider A, Entezari A, Analitis A, Forsberg B, Ameling C, Houthuijs D, Indermitte E, Mayvaneh F, Acquaotta F, de’Donato F, Carrasco-Escobar G, Orru H, Katsouyanni K, de Sousa Zanotti Stagliorio Coelho M, Ortega N, Scovronick N, Michelozzi P, Correa P, Nascimento Saldiva P, Abrutzky R, Osorio S, Colistro V, Huber V, Honda Y, Kim Y, Bell M, Xu R, Yang Z, Roradeh H, Félix Arellano E, Rao S, Carlos Chua P, da Silva S, da Silva S, De la Cruz Valencia C (2024). Global and Regional Cardiovascular Mortality Attributable to Nonoptimal Temperatures Over Time. Journal of the American College of Cardiology , vol. 83(23), pp. 2276-2287.  10.1016/j.jacc.2024.03.425. \n\n\nBackground. The association between nonoptimal temperatures and cardiovascular mortality risk is recognized. However, a comprehensive global assessment of this burden is lacking. Objectives. The goal of this study was to assess global cardiovascular mortality burden attributable to nonoptimal temperatures and investigate spatiotemporal trends. Methods. Using daily cardiovascular deaths and temperature data from 32 countries, a 3-stage analytical approach was applied. First, location-specific temperature–mortality associations were estimated, considering nonlinearity and delayed effects. Second, a multivariate meta-regression model was developed between location-specific effect estimates and 5 meta-predictors. Third, cardiovascular deaths associated with nonoptimal, cold, and hot temperatures for each global grid (55 km × 55 km resolution) were estimated, and temporal trends from 2000 to 2019 were explored. Results. Globally, 1,801,513 (95% empirical CI: 1,526,632-2,202,831) annual cardiovascular deaths were associated with nonoptimal temperatures, constituting 8.86% (95% empirical CI: 7.51%-12.32%) of total cardiovascular mortality corresponding to 26 deaths per 100,000 population. Cold-related deaths accounted for 8.20% (95% empirical CI: 6.74%-11.57%), whereas heat-related deaths accounted for 0.66% (95% empirical CI: 0.49%-0.98%). The mortality burden varied significantly across regions, with the highest excess mortality rates observed in Central Asia and Eastern Europe. From 2000 to 2019, cold-related excess death ratios decreased, while heat-related ratios increased, resulting in an overall decline in temperature-related deaths. Southeastern Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa, and Oceania observed the greatest reduction, while Southern Asia experienced an increase. The Americas and several regions in Asia and Europe displayed fluctuating temporal patterns. Conclusions. Nonoptimal temperatures substantially contribute to cardiovascular mortality, with heterogeneous spatiotemporal patterns. Effective mitigation and adaptation strategies are crucial, especially given the increasing heat-related cardiovascular deaths amid climate change. cardiovascular mortality nonoptimal temperatures global assessment spatiotemporal trends climate impact\n\n\ncardiovascular mortalitynonoptimal temperaturesglobal assessmentspatiotemporal trendsclimate impact\n\n\n\n\n\nZhao Q, Li S, Ye T, Wu Y, Gasparrini A, Tong S, Urban A, Vicedo-Cabrera A, Tobias A, Armstrong B, Royé D, Lavigne E, de’Donato F, Sera F, Kan H, Schwartz J, Pascal M, Ryti N, Goodman P, Saldiva P, Bell M, Guo Y (2024). Global, regional, and national burden of heatwave related mortality from 1990 to 2019: A three stage modelling study. PLOS Medicine , vol. 21(5), art.  no. e1004364. 10.1371/journal.pmed.1004364. \n\n\nBackground. The regional disparity of heatwave-related mortality over a long period has not been sufficiently assessed across the globe, impeding the localisation of adaptation planning and risk management towards climate change. We quantified the global mortality burden associated with heatwaves at a spatial resolution of 0.5°×0.5° and the temporal change from 1990 to 2019. Methods and findings. We collected data on daily deaths and temperature from 750 locations of 43 countries or regions, and 5 meta-predictors in 0.5°×0.5° resolution across the world. Heatwaves were defined as location-specific daily mean temperature ≥95th percentiles of year-round temperature range with duration ≥2 days. We first estimated the location-specific heatwave-mortality association. Secondly, a multivariate meta-regression was fitted between location-specific associations and 5 meta-predictors, which was in the third stage used with grid cell-specific meta-predictors to predict grid cell-specific association. Heatwave-related excess deaths were calculated for each grid and aggregated. During 1990 to 2019, 0.94% (95% CI: 0.68–1.19) of deaths [i.e., 153,078 cases (95% eCI: 109,950–194,227)] per warm season were estimated to be from heatwaves, accounting for 236 (95% eCI: 170–300) deaths per 10 million residents. The ratio between heatwave-related excess deaths and all premature deaths per warm season remained relatively unchanged over the 30 years, while the number of heatwave-related excess deaths per 10 million residents per warm season declined by 7.2% per decade in comparison to the 30-year average. Locations with the highest heatwave-related death ratio and rate were in Southern and Eastern Europe or areas had polar and alpine climates, and/or their residents had high incomes. The temporal change of heatwave-related mortality burden showed geographic disparities, such that locations with tropical climate or low incomes were observed with the greatest decline. The main limitation of this study was the lack of data from certain regions, e.g., Arabian Peninsula and South Asia. Conclusions. Heatwaves were associated with substantial mortality burden that varied spatiotemporally over the globe in the past 30 years. The findings indicate the potential benefit of governmental actions to enhance health sector adaptation and resilience, accounting for inequalities across communities. heatwave-related mortality global burden temporal change spatiotemporal analysis\n\n\nheatwave-related mortalityglobal burdentemporal changespatiotemporal analysis\n\n\n\n\n\nWu Y, Wen B, Gasparrini A, Armstrong B, Sera F, Lavigne E, Li S, Guo Y, Overcenco A, Urban A, Schneider A, Entezari A, Vicedo-Cabrera A, Zanobetti A, Analitis A, Zeka A, Tobias A, Nunes B, Alahmad B, Forsberg B, Íñiguez C, Ameling C, la Cruz Valencia C, Houthuijs D, Van Dung D, Royé D, Indermitte E, Mayvaneh F, Acquaotta F, de’Donato F, Carrasco-Escobar G, Kan H, Carlsen H, Orru H, Kim H, Holobaca I, Kyselý J, Madureira J, Schwartz J, Jaakkola J, Katsouyanni K, Diaz M, Ragettli M, Hashizume M, Pascal M, de Sousa Zanotti Stagliorio Coelho M, Ortega N, Ryti N, Scovronick N, Michelozzi P, Correa P, Goodman P, Nascimento Saldiva P, Raz R, Abrutzky R, Osorio S, Pan S, Rao S, Tong S, Achilleos S, Dang T, Colistro V, Huber V, Lee W, Seposo X, Honda Y, Kim Y, Guo Y, Li S, Guo Y (2024). Temperature frequency and mortality: Assessing adaptation to local temperature. Environment International , vol. 187, art.  no. 108691. 10.1016/j.envint.2024.108691. \n\n\nAssessing the association between temperature frequency and mortality can provide insights into human adaptation to local ambient temperatures. We collected daily time-series data on mortality and temperature from 757 locations in 47 countries/regions during 1979–2020. We used a two-stage time series design to assess the association between temperature frequency and all-cause mortality. The results were pooled at the national, regional, and global levels. We observed a consistent decrease in the risk of mortality as the normalized frequency of temperature increases across the globe. The average increase in mortality risk comparing the 10th to 100th percentile of normalized frequency was 13.03% (95% CI: 12.17–13.91), with substantial regional differences (from 4.56% in Australia and New Zealand to 33.06% in South Europe). The highest increase in mortality was observed for high-income countries (13.58%, 95% CI: 12.56–14.61), followed by lower-middle-income countries (12.34%, 95% CI: 9.27–15.51). This study observed a declining risk of mortality associated with higher temperature frequency. Our findings suggest that populations can adapt to their local climate with frequent exposure, with the adapting ability varying geographically due to differences in climatic and socioeconomic characteristics. temperature adaptation frequency mortality climate change\n\n\ntemperatureadaptationfrequencymortalityclimate change\n\n\n\n\n\nMadaniyazi L, Alpízar J, Cifuentes L, Riojas-Rodríguez H, Hurtado Díaz M, de Sousa Zanotti Stagliorio Coelho M, Abrutzky R, Osorio S, Carrasco Escobar G, Valdés Ortega N, Colistro V, Royé D, Tobías A (2024). Health and Economic Benefits of Complying With the World Health Organization Air Quality Guidelines for Particulate Matter in Nine Major Latin American Cities. International Journal of Public Health , vol. 69, art.  no. 1606909. 10.3389/ijph.2024.1606909. \n\n\nObjectives: This study aims to estimate the short-term preventable mortality and associated economic costs of complying with the World Health Organization (WHO) air quality guidelines (AQGs) limit values for PM10 and PM2.5 in nine major Latin American cities. Methods: We estimated city-specific PM-mortality associations using time-series regression models and calculated the attributable mortality fraction. Next, we used the value of statistical life to calculate the economic benefits of complying with the WHO AQGs limit values. Results: In most cities, PM concentrations exceeded the WHO AQGs limit values more than 90% of the days. PM10 was found to be associated with an average excess mortality of 1.88% with concentrations above WHO AQGs limit values, while for PM2.5 it was 1.05%. The associated annual economic costs varied widely, between US$ 19.5 million to 3,386.9 million for PM10, and US$ 196.3 million to 2,209.6 million for PM2.5. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that there is an urgent need for policymakers to develop interventions to achieve sustainable air quality improvements in Latin America. Complying with the WHO AQGs limit values for PM10 and PM2.5 in Latin American cities would substantially benefits for urban populations. air quality guidelines particulate matter health benefits economic benefits latin american cities\n\n\nair quality guidelinesparticulate matterhealth benefitseconomic benefitslatin american cities\n\n\n\n\n\nWen B, Wu Y, Guo Y, Gasparrini A, Tong S, Overcenco A, Urban A, Schneider A, Entezari A, Vicedo-Cabrera A, Zanobetti A, Analitis A, Zeka A, Tobias A, Nunes B, Alahmad B, Armstrong B, Forsberg B, Pan S, Íñiguez C, Ameling C, Valencia C, Åström C, Houthuijs D, Van Dung D, Royé D, Indermitte E, Lavigne E, Mayvaneh F, Acquaotta F, de’Donato F, Rao S, Sera F, Carrasco-Escobar G, Kan H, Orru H, Kim H, Holobaca I, Kyselý J, Madureira J, Schwartz J, Jaakkola J, Katsouyanni K, Diaz M, Ragettli M, Hashizume M, Pascal M, Coélho M, Ortega N, Ryti N, Scovronick N, Michelozzi P, Matus Correa P, Goodman P, Saldiva P, Raz R, Abrutzky R, Osorio S, Dang T, Colistro V, Huber V, Lee W, Seposo X, Honda Y, Kim Y, Guo Y, Bell M, Li S (2024). Comparison for the effects of different components of temperature variability on mortality: A multicountry timeseries study. Environment International , vol. 187, art.  no. 108712. 10.1016/j.envint.2024.108712. \n\n\nBackground. Temperature variability (TV) is associated with increased mortality risk. However, it is still unknown whether intra-day or inter-day TV has different effects. Objectives. We aimed to assess the association of intra-day TV and inter-day TV with all-cause, cardiovascular, and respiratory mortality. Methods. We collected data on total, cardiovascular, and respiratory mortality and meteorology from 758 locations in 47 countries or regions from 1972 to 2020. We defined inter-day TV as the standard deviation (SD) of daily mean temperatures across the lag interval, and intra-day TV as the average SD of minimum and maximum temperatures on each day. In the first stage, inter-day and intra-day TVs were modelled simultaneously in the quasi-Poisson time-series model for each location. In the second stage, a multi-level analysis was used to pool the location-specific estimates. Results. Overall, the mortality risk due to each interquartile range [IQR] increase was higher for intra-day TV than for inter-day TV. The risk increased by 0.59% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.53, 0.65) for all-cause mortality, 0.64% (95% CI: 0.56, 0.73) for cardiovascular mortality, and 0.65% (95% CI: 0.49, 0.80) for respiratory mortality per IQR increase in intra-day TV0–7 (0.9 °C). An IQR increase in inter-day TV0–7 (1.6 °C) was associated with 0.22% (95% CI: 0.18, 0.26) increase in all-cause mortality, 0.44% (95% CI: 0.37, 0.50) increase in cardiovascular mortality, and 0.31% (95% CI: 0.21, 0.41) increase in respiratory mortality. The proportion of all-cause deaths attributable to intra-day TV0–7 and inter-day TV0–7 was 1.45% and 0.35%, respectively. The mortality risks varied by lag interval, climate area, season, and climate type. Conclusions. Our results indicated that intra-day TV may explain the main part of the mortality risk related to TV and suggested that comprehensive evaluations should be proposed in more countries to help protect human health. temperature variability mortality inter-day intra-day\n\n\ntemperature variabilitymortalityinter-dayintra-day\n\n\n\n\n\nGincheva A, Pausas J, Edwards A, Provenzale A, Cerdà A, Hanes C, Royé D, Chuvieco E, Mouillot F, Vissio G, Rodrigo J, Bedía J, Abatzoglou J, Senciales González J, Short K, Baudena M, Llasat M, Magnani M, Boer M, González M, Torres-Vázquez M, Fiorucci P, Jacklyn P, Libonati R, Trigo R, Herrera S, Jerez S, Wang X, Turco M (2024).

Scientific Data , vol. 11(352. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-024-03141-2 \n\n\nWe assembled the first gridded burned area (BA) database of national wildfire data (ONFIRE), a comprehensive and integrated resource for researchers, non-government organisations, and government agencies analysing wildfires in various regions of the Earth. We extracted and harmonised records from different regions and sources using open and reproducible methods, providing data in a common framework for the whole period available (starting from 1950 in Australia, 1959 in Canada, 1985 in Chile, 1980 in Europe, and 1984 in the United States) up to 2021 on a common 1° × 1° grid. The data originate from national agencies (often, ground mapping), thus representing the best local expert knowledge. Key opportunities and limits in using this dataset are discussed as well as possible future expansions of this open-source approach that should be explored. This dataset complements existing gridded BA data based on remote sensing and offers a valuable opportunity to better understand and assess fire regime changes, and their drivers, in these regions.

Impact of population aging on future temperature related mortality at different global warming levels. Nature Communications , vol. 15, art.  no. 1796. 10.1038/s41467-024-45901-z. \n\n\nOlder adults are generally amongst the most vulnerable to heat and cold. While temperature-related health impacts are projected to increase with global warming, the influence of population aging on these trends remains unclear. Here we show that at 1.5 °C, 2 °C, and 3 °C of global warming, heat-related mortality in 800 locations across 50 countries/areas will increase by 0.5%, 1.0%, and 2.5%, respectively; among which 1 in 5 to 1 in 4 heat-related deaths can be attributed to population aging. Despite a projected decrease in cold-related mortality due to progressive warming alone, population aging will mostly counteract this trend, leading to a net increase in cold-related mortality by 0.1%–0.4% at 1.5–3 °C global warming. Our findings indicate that population aging constitutes a crucial driver for future heat- and cold-related deaths, with increasing mortality burden for both heat and cold due to the aging population. population aging temperature-related mortality global warming levels heat and cold mortality future projections\n\n\npopulation agingtemperature-related mortalityglobal warming levelsheat and cold mortalityfuture projections\n\n\n\n\n\nGao Y, Huang W, Zhao Q, Ryti N, Armstrong B, Gasparrini A, Tong S, Pascal M, Urban A, Zeka A, Lavigne E, Madureira J, Goodman P, Huber V, Forsberg B, Kyselý J, Sera F, Guo Y, Li S, Gao Y, Huang W, Zhao Q, Ryti N, Armstrong B, Gasparrini A, Tong S, Pascal M, Urban A, Zeka A, Lavigne E, Madureira J, Goodman P, Huber V, Forsberg B, Kyselý J, Sera F, Bell M, Hales S, Honda Y, Jaakkola J, Tobias A, Vicedo-Cabrera A, Abrutzky R, Coelho M, Saldiva P, Correa P, Ortega N, Kan H, Osorio S, Royé D, Orru H, Indermitte E, Schneider A, Katsouyanni K, Analitis A, Carlsen H, Mayvaneh F, Roradeh H, Raz R, Michelozzi P, de’Donato F, Hashizume M, Kim Y, Alahmad B, Cauchy J, Diaz M, Arellano E, Valencia C, Overcenco A, Houthuijs D, Ameling C, Rao S, Carrasco G, Seposo X, Chua P, Silva S, Nunes B, Holobaca I, Cvijanovic I, Mistry M, Scovronick N, Acquaotta F, Kim H, Lee W, Íñiguez C, Åström C, Ragettli M, Guo Y, Pan S, Colistro V, Zanobetti A, Schwartz J, Dang T, Dung D, Guo Y, Li S (2024). Global, regional, and national burden of mortality associated with cold spells during 2000–19: a three stage modelling study. The Lancet Planetary Health , vol. 8(2), pp. e108-e116.  10.1016/S2542-5196(23)00277-2. \n\n\nBackground. Exposure to cold spells is associated with mortality. However, little is known about the global mortality burden of cold spells. Methods. A three-stage meta-analytical method was used to estimate the global mortality burden associated with cold spells by means of a time series dataset of 1960 locations across 59 countries (or regions). First, we fitted the location-specific, cold spell-related mortality associations using a quasi-Poisson regression with a distributed lag non-linear model with a lag period of up to 21 days. Second, we built a multivariate meta-regression model between location-specific associations and seven predictors. Finally, we predicted the global grid-specific cold spell-related mortality associations during 2000–19 using the fitted meta-regression model and the yearly grid-specific meta-predictors. We calculated the annual excess deaths, excess death ratio (excess deaths per 1000 deaths), and excess death rate (excess deaths per 100 000 population) due to cold spells for each grid across the world. Findings.Globally, 205 932 (95% empirical CI [eCI] 162 692–250 337) excess deaths, representing 3·81 (95% eCI 2·93–4·71) excess deaths per 1000 deaths (excess death ratio), and 3·03 (2·33–3·75) excess deaths per 100 000 population (excess death rate) were associated with cold spells per year between 2000 and 2019. The annual average global excess death ratio in 2016–19 increased by 0·12 percentage points and the excess death rate in 2016–19 increased by 0·18 percentage points, compared with those in 2000–03. The mortality burden varied geographically. The excess death ratio and rate were highest in Europe, whereas these indicators were lowest in Africa. Temperate climates had higher excess death ratio and rate associated with cold spells than other climate zones. Interpretation. Cold spells are associated with substantial mortality burden around the world with geographically varying patterns. Although the number of cold spells has on average been decreasing since year 2000, the public health threat of cold spells remains substantial. The findings indicate an urgency of taking local and regional measures to protect the public from the mortality burdens of cold spells.

Seasonality of mortality under climate change: a multicountry projection study. The Lancet Planetary Health , vol. 8(2), pp. e86-e94.  10.1016/s25425196(23)00269-3. \n\n\nBackground. Climate change can directly impact temperature-related excess deaths and might subsequently change the seasonal variation in mortality. In this study, we aimed to provide a systematic and comprehensive assessment of potential future changes in the seasonal variation, or seasonality, of mortality across different climate zones. Methods. In this modelling study, we collected daily time series of mean temperature and mortality (all causes or non-external causes only) via the Multi-Country Multi-City Collaborative (MCC) Research Network. These data were collected during overlapping periods, spanning from Jan 1, 1969 to Dec 31, 2020. We projected daily mortality from Jan 1, 2000 to Dec 31, 2099, under four climate change scenarios corresponding to increasing emissions (Shared Socioeconomic Pathways [SSP] scenarios SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5). We compared the seasonality in projected mortality between decades by its shape, timings (the day-of-year) of minimum (trough) and maximum (peak) mortality, and sizes (peak-to-trough ratio and attributable fraction). Attributable fraction was used to measure the burden of seasonality of mortality. The results were summarised by climate zones. Findings. The MCC dataset included 126 809 537 deaths from 707 locations within 43 countries or areas. After excluding the only two polar locations (both high-altitude locations in Peru) from climatic zone assessments, we analysed 126 766 164 deaths in 705 locations aggregated in four climate zones (tropical, arid, temperate, and continental). From the 2000s to the 2090s, our projections showed an increase in mortality during the warm seasons and a decrease in mortality during the cold seasons, albeit with mortality remaining high during the cold seasons, under all four SSP scenarios in the arid, temperate, and continental zones. The magnitude of this changing pattern was more pronounced under the high-emission scenarios (SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5), substantially altering the shape of seasonality of mortality and, under the highest emission scenario (SSP5-8.5), shifting the mortality peak from cold seasons to warm seasons in arid, temperate, and continental zones, and increasing the size of seasonality in all zones except the arid zone by the end of the century. In the 2090s compared with the 2000s, the change in peak-to-trough ratio (relative scale) ranged from 0·96 to 1·11, and the change in attributable fraction ranged from 0·002% to 0·06% under the SSP5-8.5 (highest emission) scenario. Interpretation. A warming climate can substantially change the seasonality of mortality in the future. Our projections suggest that health-care systems should consider preparing for a potentially increased demand during warm seasons and sustained high demand during cold seasons, particularly in regions characterised by arid, temperate, and continental climates. seasonality of mortality climate change multicountry projection temperature-related deaths future climate scenarios\n\n\nseasonality of mortalityclimate changemulticountry projectiontemperature-related deathsfuture climate scenarios\n\n\n\n\n\nRoyé D, Íñiguez C, Tobías A (2024). Comparison of Air Pollution–Mortality Associations Using Observed Particulate Matter Concentrations and Reanalysis Data in 33 Spanish Cities. Environment & Health , vol. 2(3), pp. 161-169.  10.1021/envhealth.3c00128. \n\n\nAir pollution poses a health hazard in all countries. However, complete data on ambient particulate matter (PM) concentrations are not available in all world regions. Reanalysis data is already a valuable source of exposure data in epidemiological studies examining the relationship between temperature and health. Nevertheless, the performance of reanalysis data in assessing the short-term health effects of particulate air pollution remains unclear. We assessed the performance of CAMS reanalysis (EAC4) data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, compared with daily PM concentrations from field monitoring stations, to estimate short-term exposure to PM with an aerodynamic diameter less than 10 μm (PM10) on daily mortality in 33 Spanish provincial capital cities using a two-stage time series regression design. The shape of the PM10 distribution varied substantially between PM observations and CAMS global reanalysis of atmospheric composition (EAC4) reanalysis data, with correlation ranging from 0.21 to 0.58. The pooled mortality risk for a 10 μg/m3 increase in PM10 showed similar estimates using PM concentrations {relative risks (RR) = 1.007, 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) = [1.002, 1.011]} and EAC4 reanalysis data (RR = 1.011, 95% CI = [1.006, 1.015]). However, the city-specific PM10 beta coefficients estimated using PM concentrations and EAC4 reanalysis data showed a low correlation (r = 0.22). The use of reanalysis data should be approached with caution when assessing the association between particulate matter air pollution and health outcomes, particularly in cities with small populations. air pollution particulate matter pm10 reanalysis eac4 mortality spain time series regression\n\n\nair pollutionparticulate matterpm10reanalysiseac4mortalityspaintime series regression\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2023\n\n\n\nStafoggia M, Michelozzi P, Schneider A, Armstrong B, Scortichini M, Rai M, Achilleos S, Alahmad B, Analitis A, Åström C, Bell M, Calleja N, Krage Carlsen H, Carrasco G, Paul Cauchi J, DSZS Coelho M, Correa P, Diaz M, Entezari A, Forsberg B, Garland R, Leon Guo Y, Guo Y, Hashizume M, Holobaca I, Íñiguez C, Jaakkola J, Kan H, Katsouyanni K, Kim H, Kyselý J, Lavigne E, Lee W, Li S, Maasikmets M, Madureira J, Mayvaneh F, Fook Sheng Ng C, Nunes B, Orru H, V Ortega N, Osorio S, Palomares A, Pan S, Pascal M, Ragettli M, Rao S, Raz R, Royé D, Ryti N, HN Saldiva P, Samoli E, Schwartz J, Scovronick N, Sera F, Tobias A, Tong S, DLC Valencia C, Maria Vicedo-Cabrera A, Urban A, Gasparrini A, Breitner S, de’ Donato F (2023). Joint effect of heat and air pollution on mortality in 620 cities of 36 countries. Environment International , vol. 181, art.  no. 108258. 10.1016/j.envint.2023.108258. \n\n\nBackground. The epidemiological evidence on the interaction between heat and ambient air pollution on mortality is still inconsistent. Objectives. To investigate the interaction between heat and ambient air pollution on daily mortality in a large dataset of 620 cities from 36 countries. Methods. We used daily data on all-cause mortality, air temperature, particulate matter ≤ 10 μm (PM10), PM ≤ 2.5 μm (PM2.5), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and ozone (O3) from 620 cities in 36 countries in the period 1995–2020. We restricted the analysis to the six consecutive warmest months in each city. City-specific data were analysed with over-dispersed Poisson regression models, followed by a multilevel random-effects meta-analysis. The joint association between air temperature and air pollutants was modelled with product terms between non-linear functions for air temperature and linear functions for air pollutants. Results. We analyzed 22,630,598 deaths. An increase in mean temperature from the 75th to the 99th percentile of city-specific distributions was associated with an average 8.9 % (95 % confidence interval: 7.1 %, 10.7 %) mortality increment, ranging between 5.3 % (3.8 %, 6.9 %) and 12.8 % (8.7 %, 17.0 %), when daily PM10 was equal to 10 or 90 μg/m3, respectively. Corresponding estimates when daily O3 concentrations were 40 or 160 μg/m3 were 2.9 % (1.1 %, 4.7 %) and 12.5 % (6.9 %, 18.5 %), respectively. Similarly, a 10 μg/m3 increment in PM10 was associated with a 0.54 % (0.10 %, 0.98 %) and 1.21 % (0.69 %, 1.72 %) increase in mortality when daily air temperature was set to the 1st and 99th city-specific percentiles, respectively. Corresponding mortality estimate for O3 across these temperature percentiles were 0.00 % (-0.44 %, 0.44 %) and 0.53 % (0.38 %, 0.68 %). Similar effect modification results, although slightly weaker, were found for PM2.5 and NO2. Conclusions. Suggestive evidence of effect modification between air temperature and air pollutants on mortality during the warm period was found in a global dataset of 620 cities. air temperature air pollution effect modification epidemiology mortality\n\n\nair temperatureair pollutioneffect modificationepidemiologymortality\n\n\n\n\n\nDíaz-Poso A, Lorenzo N, Martí A, Royé D (2023). Cold wave intensity on the Iberian Peninsula: Future climate projections. Atmospheric Research , vol. 295, art.  no. 107011. 10.1016/j.atmosres.2023.107011. \n\n\nIn the context of global warming, cold waves have generated less interest in the scientific community than heat waves, despite their impacts on public health, transport infrastructures and energy consumption. The present study analyses climate change scenarios with simulations of the EURO-CORDEX project, using the Excess Cold Factor (ECF) index for the Iberian Peninsula and Balearic Islands (IPB). The dimensions of intensity, frequency, duration and spatial extent are evaluated for the near future (2021–2050) with respect to the historical period of reference (1971–2000). The projections show a significant overall decrease in all dimensions. The mean change in maximum cold wave intensity is −50% over most of the IPB as a whole in the near future (2021–2050). The largest changes occur in the interior of the Peninsula, where the decrease is around −100%. The annual mean number of cold wave days decreases for the IPB as a whole by −50% compared to 1971–2000, with the maximum extent decreasing by more than the mean, with decreases of between −2.4%/decade and − 5.5%/decade. Although a smaller number of cold waves suggests less human exposure, the acclimatisation of the population to higher temperatures will imply that cold waves will continue to pose a serious local threat. ecf cold wave intensity spatial extent climate change future projections\n\n\necfcold waveintensityspatial extentclimate changefuture projections\n\n\n\n\n\nUhl J, Royé D, Burghardt K, Aldrey Vázquez J, Borobio Sanchiz M, Leyk S (2023). HISDACES: historical settlement data compilation for Spain (1900–2020. https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-15-4713-2023 \n\n\nMulti-temporal measurements quantifying the changes to the Earth’s surface are critical for understanding many natural, anthropogenic, and social processes. Researchers typically use remotely sensed Earth observation data to quantify and characterize such changes in land use and land cover (LULC). However, such data sources are limited in their availability prior to the 1980s. While an observational window of 40 to 50 years is sufficient to study most recent LULC changes, processes such as urbanization, land development, and the evolution of urban and coupled nature–human systems often operate over longer time periods covering several decades or even centuries. Thus, to quantify and better understand such processes, alternative historical–geospatial data sources are required that extend farther back in time. However, such data are rare, and processing is labor-intensive, often involving manual work. To overcome the resulting lack in quantitative knowledge of urban systems and the built environment prior to the 1980s, we leverage cadastral data with rich thematic property attribution, such as building usage and construction year. We scraped, harmonized, and processed over 12 000 000 building footprints including construction years to create a multi-faceted series of gridded surfaces, describing the evolution of human settlements in Spain from 1900 to 2020, at 100 m spatial and 5-year temporal resolution. These surfaces include measures of building density, built-up intensity, and built-up land use. We evaluated our data against a variety of data sources including remotely sensed human settlement data and land cover data, model-based historical land use depictions, and historical maps and historical aerial imagery and find high levels of agreement. This new data product, the Historical Settlement Data Compilation for Spain (HISDAC-ES), is publicly available (https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.22009643, Uhl et al., 2023a) and represents a rich source for quantitative, long-term analyses of the built environment and related processes over large spatial and temporal extents and at fine resolutions. historical settlement data spain land use and land cover urbanization geospatial analysis\n\n\nhistorical settlement dataspainland use and land coverurbanizationgeospatial analysis\n\n\n\n\n\nTobías A, Íñiguez C, Royé D (2023). From Research to the Development of an Innovative Application for Monitoring HeatRelated Mortality in Spain. Environment & Health , vol. 1(6. https://doi.org/10.1021/envhealth.3c00134 \n\n\nExposure to heat poses a major threat to high-risk populations by substantially contributing to increased mortality and morbidity. Heat-related mortality has been a significant concern since the summer of 2003, when Europe experienced a heatwave, leading to an excess of more than 70,000 deaths during the summer months, with 3,166 of those occurring in Spain. Heat-health early warning systems can reduce the burden of high ambient temperatures. However, the evidence of their effectiveness is limited. Therefore, developing innovative tools for real-time monitoring and forecast of health impacts from heat becomes essential for effective public health interventions and resource allocation strategies. We developed a user-friendly and accessible tool for monitoring heat-attributable mortality in Spain during the summer season between June and August. https://ficlima.shinyapps.io/mace/ heat-related mortality innovative application real-time monitoring public health spain\n\n\nheat-related mortalityinnovative applicationreal-time monitoringpublic healthspain\n\n\n\n\n\nLiu C, Chen R, Sera F, Vicedo-Cabrera A, Guo Y, Tong S, Lavigne E, Correa P, Ortega N, Achilleos S, Royé D, Jaakkola J, Ryti N, Pascal M, Schneider A, Breitner S, Entezari A, Mayvaneh F, Raz R, Honda Y, Hashizume M, Ng C, Gaio V, Madureira J, Holobaca I, Tobias A, Íñiguez C, Guo Y, Pan S, Masselot P, Bell M, Zanobetti A, Schwartz J, Gasparrini A, Kan H (2023). Interactive effects of ambient fine particulate matter and ozone on daily mortality in 372 cities: two stage time series analysis. BMJ , vol. 383, art.  no. e075203. 10.1136/bmj-2023-075203. \n\n\nObjective: To investigate potential interactive effects of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and ozone (O3) on daily mortality at global level. Design: Two stage time series analysis. Setting: 372 cities across 19 countries and regions. Population: Daily counts of deaths from all causes, cardiovascular disease, and respiratory disease. Main outcome measure: Daily mortality data during 1994-2020. Stratified analyses by co-pollutant exposures and synergy index (1 denotes the combined effect of pollutants is greater than individual effects) were applied to explore the interaction between PM2.5 and O3 in association with mortality. Results: During the study period across the 372 cities, 19.3 million deaths were attributable to all causes, 5.3 million to cardiovascular disease, and 1.9 million to respiratory disease. The risk of total mortality for a 10 μg/m3 increment in PM2.5 (lag 0-1 days) ranged from 0.47% (95% confidence interval 0.26% to 0.67%) to 1.25% (1.02% to 1.48%) from the lowest to highest fourths of O3 concentration; and for a 10 μg/m3 increase in O3 ranged from 0.04% (-0.09% to 0.16%) to 0.29% (0.18% to 0.39%) from the lowest to highest fourths of PM2.5 concentration, with significant differences between strata (P for interaction 0.001). A significant synergistic interaction was also identified between PM2.5 and O3 for total mortality, with a synergy index of 1.93 (95% confidence interval 1.47 to 3.34). Subgroup analyses showed that interactions between PM2.5 and O3 on all three mortality endpoints were more prominent in high latitude regions and during cold seasons. Conclusion: The findings of this study suggest a synergistic effect of PM2.5 and O3 on total, cardiovascular, and respiratory mortality, indicating the benefit of coordinated control strategies for both pollutants. fine particulate matter (pm2.5) ozone (o3) daily mortality two-stage time series synergistic effects\n\n\nfine particulate matter (pm2.5)ozone (o3)daily mortalitytwo-stage time seriessynergistic effects\n\n\n\n\n\nLüthi S, Fairless C, Fischer EM, Scovronick N, Armstrong B, De Sousa Zanotti Stagliorio Coelho M, Guo YL, Guo Y, Honda Y, Huber V, Kyselý J, Lavigne E, Royé D, Ryti N, Silva S, Urban A, Gasparrini A, Bresch DN, Vicedo-Cabrera AM (2023). Rapid increase in the risk of heatrelated mortality. Nature Communications , vol. 14, art.  no. 4894. 10.1038/s41467-023-40599-x. \n\n\nHeat-related mortality has been identified as one of the key climate extremes posing a risk to human health. Current research focuses largely on how heat mortality increases with mean global temperature rise, but it is unclear how much climate change will increase the frequency and severity of extreme summer seasons with high impact on human health. In this probabilistic analysis, we combined empirical heat-mortality relationships for 748 locations from 47 countries with climate model large ensemble data to identify probable past and future highly impactful summer seasons. Across most locations, heat mortality counts of a 1-in-100 year season in the climate of 2000 would be expected once every ten to twenty years in the climate of 2020. These return periods are projected to further shorten under warming levels of 1.5 °C and 2 °C, where heat-mortality extremes of the past climate will eventually become commonplace if no adaptation occurs. Our findings highlight the urgent need for strong mitigation and adaptation to reduce impacts on human lives. extreme heat climate change heatwaves public health risk assessment\n\n\nextreme heatclimate changeheatwavespublic healthrisk assessment\n\n\n\n\n\nHuang W, Li S, Vogt T, Xu R, Tong S, Molina T, Masselot P, Gasparrini A, Armstrong B, Pascal M, Royé D, Sheng Ng C, Vicedo-Cabrera A, Schwartz J, Lavigne E, Kan H, Goodman P, Zeka A, Hashizume M, Diaz M, De la Cruz Valencia C, Seposo X, Nunes B, Madureira J, Kim H, Lee W, Tobias A, Íñiguez C, Guo Y, Pan S, Zanobetti A, Dang T, Van Dung D, Geiger T, Otto C, Johnson A, Hales S, Yu P, Yang Z, Ritchie E, Guo Y (2023). Global shortterm mortality risk and burden associated with tropical cyclones from 1980 to 2019: a multicountry timeseries study. The Lancet Planetary Health , vol. 7(8), pp. e694-e705.  10.1016/S2542-5196(23)00143-2. \n\n\nBackground. The global spatiotemporal pattern of mortality risk and burden attributable to tropical cyclones is unclear. We aimed to evaluate the global short-term mortality risk and burden associated with tropical cyclones from 1980 to 2019. Methods. The wind speed associated with cyclones from 1980 to 2019 was estimated globally through a parametric wind field model at a grid resolution of 0·5° × 0·5°. A total of 341 locations with daily mortality and temperature data from 14 countries that experienced at least one tropical cyclone day (a day with maximum sustained wind speed associated with cyclones ≥17·5 m/s) during the study period were included. A conditional quasi-Poisson regression with distributed lag non-linear model was applied to assess the tropical cyclone–mortality association. A meta-regression model was fitted to evaluate potential contributing factors and estimate grid cell-specific tropical cyclone effects. Findings. Tropical cyclone exposure was associated with an overall 6% (95% CI 4–8) increase in mortality in the first 2 weeks following exposure. Globally, an estimate of 97 430 excess deaths (95% empirical CI [eCI] 71 651–126 438) per decade were observed over the 2 weeks following exposure to tropical cyclones, accounting for 20·7 (95% eCI 15·2–26·9) excess deaths per 100 000 residents (excess death rate) and 3·3 (95% eCI 2·4–4·3) excess deaths per 1000 deaths (excess death ratio) over 1980–2019. The mortality burden exhibited substantial temporal and spatial variation. East Asia and south Asia had the highest number of excess deaths during 1980–2019: 28 744 (95% eCI 16 863–42 188) and 27 267 (21 157–34 058) excess deaths per decade, respectively. In contrast, the regions with the highest excess death ratios and rates were southeast Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean. From 1980–99 to 2000–19, marked increases in tropical cyclone-related excess death numbers were observed globally, especially for Latin America and the Caribbean and south Asia. Grid cell-level and country-level results revealed further heterogeneous spatiotemporal patterns such as the high and increasing tropical cyclone-related mortality burden in Caribbean countries or regions. Interpretation. Globally, short-term exposure to tropical cyclones was associated with a significant mortality burden, with highly heterogeneous spatiotemporal patterns. In-depth exploration of tropical cyclone epidemiology for those countries and regions estimated to have the highest and increasing tropical cyclone-related mortality burdens is urgently needed to help inform the development of targeted actions against the increasing adverse health impacts of tropical cyclones under a changing climate. tropical cyclones short-term mortality global burden,time-series analysis spatiotemporal patterns\n\n\ntropical cyclonesshort-term mortalityglobal burden,time-series analysisspatiotemporal patterns\n\n\n\n\n\nDíaz-Poso A, Royé D, Martínez-Ibarra E (2023). Turismo y Cambio Climático: Aplicación del Holiday Climate Index (HCI:Urban) en España en los meses de verano para mediados y finales de siglo. Investigaciones Turísticas , vol. 26.  10.14198/inturi.23493. \n\n\nEn las últimas décadas el turismo ha adquirido una importancia cada vez mayor en la economía española. Con 83,5 millones de turistas en 2019, el 11.7% del PIB nacional proviene del sector turístico. El clima es uno de los principales aspectos a tener en cuenta por las personas para elegir un destino turístico. El índice Holiday Climate Index (HCI) es un indicador bioclimático que tiene en cuenta diferentes variables climáticas (temperatura, precipitación, humedad, viento y nubosidad), con el fin de determinar si las condiciones climáticas son adecuadas para las actividades turísticas de carácter urbano. Utilizando el HCI:Urban, se ha analizado la evolución de los niveles de confortabilidad climática para la Península y Baleares (PB) en verano (junio, julio y agosto) para mediados (2041-2060) y finales de siglo (2081-2100) bajo los escenarios climáticos RCP 4.5 y 8.5. Tomando como referencia el periodo 1986-2005, los resultados indican un aumento considerable del confort climático especialmente a finales de siglo en las comunidades autónomas del norte y noroeste del país, donde los valores, alcanzan la calificación de “excelente” (HCI 80-90). Paralelamente, la progresiva pérdida de confort a consecuencia del cambio climático en comunidades autónomas meridionales como Extremadura, Murcia, Andalucía e Islas Baleares, dará lugar a cambios en la distribución espacio-temporal de los flujos turísticos. Pese a que su formulación es susceptible de mejora, los datos proporcionados por el índice HCI:Urban pueden ser útiles en el desarrollo de instrumentos de planificación urbana, facilitando a las autoridades la toma de decisiones en un nuevo contexto turístico. hci (holiday climate index) cambio climático confort climático turismo españa.\n\n\nhci (holiday climate index)cambio climáticoconfort climáticoturismoespaña.\n\n\n\n\n\nLo Y, Mitchell D, Buzan J, Zscheischler J, Schneider R, Mistry M, Kyselý J, Lavigne É, da Silva S, Royé D, Urban A, Armstrong B, Gasparrini A, Vicedo‐Cabrera A (2023). Optimal heat stress metric for modelling heat‐related mortality varies from country to country. International Journal of Climatology , vol. 43(12), pp. 5553-5568.  10.1002/joc.8160. \n\n\nCombined heat and humidity is frequently described as the main driver of human heat-related mortality, more so than dry-bulb temperature alone. While based on physiological thinking, this assumption has not been robustly supported by epidemiological evidence. By performing the first systematic comparison of eight heat stress metrics (i.e., temperature combined with humidity and other climate variables) with warm-season mortality, in 604 locations over 39 countries, we find that the optimal metric for modelling mortality varies from country to country. Temperature metrics with no or little humidity modification associates best with mortality in ~40% of the studied countries. Apparent temperature (combined temperature, humidity and wind speed) dominates in another 40% of countries. There is no obvious climate grouping in these results. We recommend, where possible, that researchers use the optimal metric for each country. However, dry-bulb temperature performs similarly to humidity-based heat stress metrics in estimating heat-related mortality in present-day climate. heat stress metrics heat-related mortality country-specific analysis climate variables epidemiological evidence\n\n\nheat stress metricsheat-related mortalitycountry-specific analysisclimate variablesepidemiological evidence\n\n\n\n\n\nGestal Romaní S, Figueiras A, Royé D (2023). Effect of Temperature on Emergency Ambulance Call Outs for Cardiovascular Causes: A Scoping Review. Environment & Health , vol. 1(1. https://doi.org/10.1021/envhealth.3c00003 \n\n\nClimate change has increased interest in the effects of the thermal environment on cardiovascular health. Most studies have focused on mortality data. However, pre-hospital care data are better able to evaluate these effects, as they can register the full spectrum of the disease in real time. This scoping review aims to synthesize the epidemiological evidence regarding the effects of the thermal environment on cardiovascular morbidity in the pre-hospital setting, evaluated through ambulance calls. A staged literature search was performed using the PubMed database for the period between 1st January 2000 and 30th March 2023, using the MeSH terms “Weather” AND “Emergency Medical Services”. A total of 987 publications were identified that examined the correlation between the thermal environment and ambulance call-outs for cardiovascular causes. The studies were mostly ecological time series, with significant variability in the methodological aspects employed. An increase in the number of ambulance call-outs has been observed in association with low temperatures, both for overall cardiovascular pathologies and for certain pathological subtypes. For high temperatures, no effect has been observed in overall call-outs, although an increase has been observed during heat waves. The demand for ambulances for cardiac arrests is increased by both low and high temperatures and during heat waves. Ambulance call-outs for cardiovascular causes increase with low temperatures and heat waves, with no significant increase in the overall demand associated with high temperatures. Ambulance call-outs for cardiac arrests are the only subtype that is increased by high temperatures. cardiovascular diseases weather cold exposure heat exposure ambulance call-out emergency medical services\n\n\ncardiovascular diseasesweathercold exposureheat exposureambulance call-outemergency medical services\n\n\n\n\n\nO’Brien E, Masselot P, Sera F, Royé D, Breitner S, Ng C, de Sousa Zanotti Stagliorio Coelho M, Madureira J, Tobias A, Vicedo-Cabrera A, Bell M, Lavigne E, Kan H, Gasparrini (2023). ShortTerm Association between Sulfur Dioxide and Mortality: A Multicountry Analysis in 399 Cities. Environmental Health Perspectives , vol. 131(3. https://doi.org/10.1289/ehp11112 \n\n\nBackground: Epidemiological evidence on the health risks of sulfur dioxide (SO2) is more limited compared with other pollutants, and doubts remain on several aspects, such as the form of the exposure–response relationship, the potential role of copollutants, as well as the actual risk at low concentrations and possible temporal variation in risks. Objectives: Our aim was to assess the short-term association between exposure to SO2 and daily mortality in a large multilocation data set, using advanced study designs and statistical techniques. Methods: The analysis included 43,729,018 deaths that occurred in 399 cities within 23 countries between 1980 and 2018. A two-stage design was applied to assess the association between the daily concentration of SO2 and mortality counts, including first-stage time-series regressions and second-stage multilevel random-effect meta-analyses. Secondary analyses assessed the exposure–response shape and the lag structure using spline terms and distributed lag models, respectively, and temporal variations in risk using a longitudinal meta-regression.

Exploring vulnerability to heat and cold across urban and rural populations in Switzerland. Environmental Research: Health , vol. 1(2), art.  no. 25003. 10.1088/2752-5309/acab78. \n\n\nHeat- and cold-related mortality risks are highly variable across different geographies, suggesting a differential distribution of vulnerability factors between and within countries, which could partly be driven by urban-to-rural disparities. Identifying these drivers of risk is crucial to characterize local vulnerability and design tailored public health interventions to improve adaptation of populations to climate change. We aimed to assess how heat- and cold-mortality risks change across urban, peri-urban and rural areas in Switzerland and to identify and compare the factors associated with increased vulnerability within and between different area typologies. We estimated the heat- and cold-related mortality association using the case time-series design and distributed lag non-linear models over daily mean temperature and all-cause mortality series between 1990-2017 in each municipality in Switzerland. Then, through multivariate meta-regression, we derived pooled heat and cold-mortality associations by typology (i.e. urban/rural/peri-urban) and assessed potential vulnerability factors among a wealth of demographic, socioeconomic, topographic, climatic, land use and other environmental data. Urban clusters reported larger pooled heat-related mortality risk (at 99th percentile, vs. temperature of minimum mortality (MMT)) (relative risk=1.17(95%CI:1.10;1.24, vs peri-urban 1.03(1.00;1.06), and rural 1.03 (0.99;1.08)), but similar cold-mortality risk (at 1st percentile, vs. MMT) (1.35(1.28;1.43), vs rural 1.28(1.14;1.44) and peri-urban 1.39 (1.27-1.53)) clusters. We found different sets of vulnerability factors explaining the differential risk patterns across typologies. In urban clusters, mainly environmental factors (i.e. PM2.5) drove differences in heat-mortality association, while for peri-urban/rural clusters socio-economic variables were also important. For cold, socio-economic variables drove changes in vulnerability across all typologies, while environmental factors and ageing were other important drivers of larger vulnerability in peri-urban/rural clusters, with heterogeneity in the direction of the association. Our findings suggest that urban populations in Switzerland may be more vulnerable to heat, compared to rural locations, and different sets of vulnerability factors may drive these associations in each typology. Thus, future public health adaptation strategies should consider local and more tailored interventions rather than a one-size fits all approach. size fits all approach. vulnerability heat cold urban-rural differences switzerland\n\n\nvulnerabilityheatcoldurban-rural differencesswitzerland\n\n\n\n\n\nDíaz-Poso A, Lorenzo N, Royé D (2023). Spatiotemporal evolution of heat waves severity and expansion across the Iberian Peninsula and Balearic islands. Environmental Research , vol. 217, art.  no. 114864. 10.1016/j.envres.2022.114864. \n\n\nIn the current climate change scenario, heat waves have become one of the most concerning extreme climatic events, both because of their implications for human health and the economy, and because of their increase in intensity and frequency in recent decades. This work presents for the first time a climatological analysis of heat waves in the Iberian Peninsula and Balearic Archipelago (IPB) using the Excess Heat Factor index (EHF). This index considers the factor of intensity and the acclimatization process of human body in the study of heat waves. We focused on the intensity (also called severity), duration, frequency and spatial extension of heat waves in the IPB in the 1950–2020 period. The exceptional heat wave of August 2018 was approached in a similar way to further explore the usefulness of the EHF index. We found that the EHF index identified heat wave conditions 2 days earlier than indices that used only maximum temperatures. Results showed a significant increase in intensity, duration, frequency and spatial extension of heat waves for the whole IPB for 1950–2020 period. The average extent of heat waves increased by 4.0% per decade and the maximum extent by 4.1% per decade. This trend suggested a significant increase in human exposure, droughts, fire risk and energy demand in this region in the last decades. ehf intensity severity heat wave extent duration\n\n\nehfintensityseverityheat waveextentduration\n\n\n\n\n\nAlahmad B, Khraishah H, Royé D, Vicedo-Cabrera A, Guo Y, Papatheodorou S, Achilleos S, Acquaotta F, Armstrong B, Bell M, Pan S, de Sousa Zanotti Stagliorio Coelho M, Colistro V, Dang T, Van Dung D, De’ Donato F, Entezari A, Guo Y, Hashizume M, Honda Y, Indermitte E, Íñiguez C, Jaakkola J, Kim H, Lavigne E, Lee W, Li S, Madureira J, Mayvaneh F, Orru H, Overcenco A, Ragettli M, Ryti N, Saldiva P, Scovronick N, Seposo X, Sera F, Silva S, Stafoggia M, Tobias A, Garshick E, Bernstein A, Zanobetti A, Schwartz J, Gasparrini A, Koutrakis P (2023). Associations Between Extreme Temperatures and Cardiovascular Cause Specific Mortality: Results From 27 Countries. Circulation , vol. 147(1. https://doi.org/10.1161/circulationaha.122.061832 \n\n\nBackground: Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide. Existing studies on the association between temperatures and cardiovascular deaths have been limited in geographic zones and have generally considered associations with total cardiovascular deaths rather than cause-specific cardiovascular deaths. Methods: We used unified data collection protocols within the Multi-Country Multi-City Collaborative Network to assemble a database of daily counts of specific cardiovascular causes of death from 567 cities in 27 countries across 5 continents in overlapping periods ranging from 1979 to 2019. City-specific daily ambient temperatures were obtained from weather stations and climate reanalysis models. To investigate cardiovascular mortality associations with extreme hot and cold temperatures, we fit case-crossover models in each city and then used a mixed-effects meta-analytic framework to pool individual city estimates. Extreme temperature percentiles were compared with the minimum mortality temperature in each location. Excess deaths were calculated for a range of extreme temperature days. Results: The analyses included deaths from any cardiovascular cause (32 154  935), ischemic heart disease (11 745 880), stroke (9 351 312), heart failure (3 673 723), and arrhythmia (670 859). At extreme temperature percentiles, heat (99th percentile) and cold (1st percentile) were associated with higher risk of dying from any cardiovascular cause, ischemic heart disease, stroke, and heart failure as compared to the minimum mortality temperature, which is the temperature associated with least mortality. Across a range of extreme temperatures, hot days (above 97.5th percentile) and cold days (below 2.5th percentile) accounted for 2.2 (95% empirical CI [eCI], 2.1–2.3) and 9.1 (95% eCI, 8.9–9.2) excess deaths for every 1000 cardiovascular deaths, respectively. Heart failure was associated with the highest excess deaths proportion from extreme hot and cold days with 2.6 (95% eCI, 2.4–2.8) and 12.8 (95% eCI, 12.2–13.1) for every 1000 heart failure deaths, respectively. Conclusions: Across a large, multinational sample, exposure to extreme hot and cold temperatures was associated with a greater risk of mortality from multiple common cardiovascular conditions. The intersections between extreme temperatures and cardiovascular health need to be thoroughly characterized in the present day—and especially under a changing climate. cardiovascular mortality extreme temperatures heat cold multi-country analysis\n\n\ncardiovascular mortalityextreme temperaturesheatcoldmulti-country analysis\n\n\n\n\n\nNottmeyer L, Armstrong B, Lowe R, Abbott S, Meakin S, O’Reilly K, von Borries R, Schneider R, Royé D, Hashizume M, Pascal M, Tobias A, Vicedo-Cabrera A, Lavigne E, Correa P, Ortega N, Kynčl J, Urban A, Orru H, Ryti N, Jaakkola J, Dallavalle M, Schneider A, Honda Y, Ng C, Alahmad B, Carrasco-Escobar G, Holobâc I, Kim H, Lee W, Íñiguez C, Bell M, Zanobetti A, Schwartz J, Scovronick N, Coélho M, Saldiva P, Diaz M, Gasparrini A, Sera F (2023). The association of COVID19 incidence with temperature, humidity, and UV radiation – A global multicity analysis. Science of The Total Environment , vol. 854, art.  no. 158636. 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.158636. \n\n\nBackground and aim. The associations between COVID-19 transmission and meteorological factors are scientifically debated. Several studies have been conducted worldwide, with inconsistent findings. However, often these studies had methodological issues, e.g., did not exclude important confounding factors, or had limited geographic or temporal resolution. Our aim was to quantify associations between temporal variations in COVID-19 incidence and meteorological variables globally. Methods. We analysed data from 455 cities across 20 countries from 3 February to 31 October 2020. We used a time-series analysis that assumes a quasi-Poisson distribution of the cases and incorporates distributed lag non-linear modelling for the exposure associations at the city-level while considering effects of autocorrelation, long-term trends, and day of the week. The confounding by governmental measures was accounted for by incorporating the Oxford Governmental Stringency Index. The effects of daily mean air temperature, relative and absolute humidity, and UV radiation were estimated by applying a meta-regression of local estimates with multi-level random effects for location, country, and climatic zone. Results. We found that air temperature and absolute humidity influenced the spread of COVID-19 over a lag period of 15 days. Pooling the estimates globally showed that overall low temperatures (7.5 °C compared to 17.0 °C) and low absolute humidity (6.0 g/m3 compared to 11.0 g/m3) were associated with higher COVID-19 incidence (RR temp =1.33 with 95%CI: 1.08; 1.64 and RR AH =1.33 with 95%CI: 1.12; 1.57). RH revealed no significant trend and for UV some evidence of a positive association was found. These results were robust to sensitivity analysis. However, the study results also emphasise the heterogeneity of these associations in different countries. Conclusion. Globally, our results suggest that comparatively low temperatures and low absolute humidity were associated with increased risks of COVID-19 incidence. However, this study underlines regional heterogeneity of weather-related effects on COVID-19 transmission. temperature humidity uv radiation covid-19 distributed lag non-linear modelling global analysis\n\n\ntemperaturehumidityuv radiationcovid-19distributed lag non-linear modellingglobal analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2022\n\n\n\nTobías A, Royé D, Iñiguez C (2022). Heatattributable Mortality in the Summer of 2022 in Spain. Epidemiology , vol. 34(2), pp. e5-e6.  10.1097/ede.0000000000001583. \n\n\nThe article examines heat-attributable mortality during the summer of 2022 in Spain, a period marked by exceptionally high temperatures. Using Poisson regression models with non-linear distributions, deaths attributable to moderate and extreme heat were estimated. In June, July, and August, temperatures exceeded extreme heat thresholds multiple times, resulting in a significant increase in mortality. The study highlights the importance of clearly defining reference scenarios to assess the impact of heat on health and underscores the need for adaptation measures to mitigate the effects of climate change. mortality extreme heat summer 2022 spain temperature\n\n\nmortalityextreme heatsummer 2022spaintemperature\n\n\n\n\n\nChoi H, Lee W, Royé D, Heo S, Urban A, Entezari A, Vicedo-Cabrera A, Zanobetti A, Gasparrini A, Analitis A, Tobias A, Armstrong B, Forsberg B, Íñiguez C, Åström C, Indermitte E, Lavigne E, Mayvaneh F, Acquaotta F, Sera F, Orru H, Kim H, Kyselý J, Madueira J, Schwartz J, Jaakkola J, Katsouyanni K, Diaz M, Ragettli M, Pascal M, Ryti N, Scovronick N, Osorio S, Tong S, Seposo X, Guo Y, Guo Y, Bell M (2022). Effect modification of greenness on the association between heat and mortality: A multicity multicountry study. eBioMedicine , vol. 84, art.  no. 104251. 10.1016/j.ebiom.2022.104251. \n\n\nBackground. Identifying how greenspace impacts the temperature-mortality relationship in urban environments is crucial, especially given climate change and rapid urbanization. However, the effect modification of greenspace on heat-related mortality has been typically focused on a localized area or single country. This study examined the heat-mortality relationship among different greenspace levels in a global setting. Methods. We collected daily ambient temperature and mortality data for 452 locations in 24 countries and used Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) as the greenspace measurement. We used distributed lag non-linear model to estimate the heat-mortality relationship in each city and the estimates were pooled adjusting for city-specific average temperature, city-specific temperature range, city-specific population density, and gross domestic product (GDP). The effect modification of greenspace was evaluated by comparing the heat-related mortality risk for different greenspace groups (low, medium, and high), which were divided into terciles among 452 locations. Findings. Cities with high greenspace value had the lowest heat-mortality relative risk of 1·19 (95% CI: 1·13, 1·25), while the heat-related relative risk was 1·46 (95% CI: 1·31, 1·62) for cities with low greenspace when comparing the 99th temperature and the minimum mortality temperature. A 20% increase of greenspace is associated with a 9·02% (95% CI: 8·88, 9·16) decrease in the heat-related attributable fraction, and if this association is causal (which is not within the scope of this study to assess), such a reduction could save approximately 933 excess deaths per year in 24 countries. Interpretation. Our findings can inform communities on the potential health benefits of greenspaces in the urban environment and mitigation measures regarding the impacts of climate change. green spaces heat mortality urbanization climate change public health\n\n\ngreen spacesheat mortalityurbanizationclimate changepublic health\n\n\n\n\n\nWu Y, Li S, Zhao Q, Wen B, Gasparrini A, Tong S, Overcenco A, Urban A, Schneider A, Entezari A, Vicedo-Cabrera A, Zanobetti A, Analitis A, Zeka A, Tobias A, Nunes B, Alahmad B, Armstrong B, Forsberg B, Pan S, Íñiguez C, Ameling C, De la Cruz Valencia C, Åström C, Houthuijs D, Van Dung D, Royé D, Indermitte E, Lavigne E, Mayvaneh F, Acquaotta F, de’Donato F, Rao S, Sera F, Carrasco-Escobar G, Kan H, Orru H, Kim H, Holobaca I, Kyselý J, Madureira J, Schwartz J, Jaakkola J, Katsouyanni K, Hurtado Diaz M, Ragettli M, Hashizume M, Pascal M, de Sousa Zanotti Stagliorio Coélho M, Ortega N, Ryti N, Scovronick N, Michelozzi P, Correa P, Goodman P, Nascimento Saldiva P, Abrutzky R, Osorio S, Dang T, Colistro V, Huber V, Lee W, Seposo X, Honda Y, Guo Y, Bell M, Guo Y (2022). Global, regional, and national burden of mortality associated with shortterm temperature variability from 2000–19: a threestage modelling study. The Lancet Planetary Health , vol. 6(5), pp. e410-e421.  10.1016/S2542-5196(22)00073-0. \n\n\nBackground. Increased mortality risk is associated with short-term temperature variability. However, to our knowledge, there has been no comprehensive assessment of the temperature variability-related mortality burden worldwide. In this study, using data from the MCC Collaborative Research Network, we first explored the association between temperature variability and mortality across 43 countries or regions. Then, to provide a more comprehensive picture of the global burden of mortality associated with temperature variability, global gridded temperature data with a resolution of 0·5° × 0·5° were used to assess the temperature variability-related mortality burden at the global, regional, and national levels. Furthermore, temporal trends in temperature variability-related mortality burden were also explored from 2000–19. Methods. In this modelling study, we applied a three-stage meta-analytical approach to assess the global temperature variability-related mortality burden at a spatial resolution of 0·5° × 0·5° from 2000–19. Temperature variability was calculated as the SD of the average of the same and previous days’ minimum and maximum temperatures. We first obtained location-specific temperature variability related-mortality associations based on a daily time series of 750 locations from the Multi-country Multi-city Collaborative Research Network. We subsequently constructed a multivariable meta-regression model with five predictors to estimate grid-specific temperature variability related-mortality associations across the globe. Finally, percentage excess in mortality and excess mortality rate were calculated to quantify the temperature variability-related mortality burden and to further explore its temporal trend over two decades. Findings. An increasing trend in temperature variability was identified at the global level from 2000 to 2019. Globally, 1 753 392 deaths (95% CI 1 159 901–2 357 718) were associated with temperature variability per year, accounting for 3·4% (2·2–4·6) of all deaths. Most of Asia, Australia, and New Zealand were observed to have a higher percentage excess in mortality than the global mean. Globally, the percentage excess in mortality increased by about 4·6% (3·7–5·3) per decade. The largest increase occurred in Australia and New Zealand (7·3%, 95% CI 4·3–10·4), followed by Europe (4·4%, 2·2–5·6) and Africa (3·3, 1·9–4·6). Interpretation. Globally, a substantial mortality burden was associated with temperature variability, showing geographical heterogeneity and a slightly increasing temporal trend. Our findings could assist in raising public awareness and improving the understanding of the health impacts of temperature variability. mortality burden temperature variability climate change global analysis public health\n\n\nmortality burdentemperature variabilityclimate changeglobal analysispublic health\n\n\n\n\n\nTedim F, Leone V, Lovreglio R, Xanthopoulos G, Chas-Amil M, Ganteaume A, Efe R, Royé D, Fuerst-Bjeliš B, Nikolov N, Musa S, Milenković M, Correia F, Conedera M, Boris Pezzatti G (2022). Forest Fire Causes and Motivations in the Southern and South Eastern Europe through Experts’ Perception and Applications to Current Policies. Forests , vol. 13(4), art.  no. 562. 10.3390/f13040562. \n\n\nForest fires causes and motivations are poorly understood in southern and south-eastern Europe. This research aims to identify how experts perceive the different causes of forest fires as defined in the classification proposed by the European Commission in 2013. A panel of experts (N = 271) was gathered from the EU Southern Member States (France, Greece, Italy, Portugal, and Spain) and from Central (Switzerland) and south-eastern Europe (Croatia, Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Republic of North Macedonia, and Turkey). Experts were asked to answer a questionnaire to score the importance of the 29 fire causes using a five point (1–5) Likert Scale. Agricultural burnings received the highest score, followed by Deliberate fire for profit, and Vegetation management. Most of the events stem from Negligence, whereas malicious fire setting is arguably overestimated although there are differences among the countries. This research demonstrates the importance of different techniques to enhance the knowledge of the causes of the complex anthropogenic phenomenon of forest fire occurrence. delphi method effis forest fire causes forest fire motivations likert scale anthropogenic causes\n\n\ndelphi methodeffisforest fire causesforest fire motivationslikert scaleanthropogenic causes\n\n\n\n\n\nMistry M, Schneider R, Masselot P, Royé D, Armstrong B, Kyselý J, Orru H, Sera F, Tong S, Lavigne É, Urban A, Madureira J, García-León D, Ibarreta D, Ciscar J, Feyen L, de Schrijver E, de Sousa Zanotti Stagliorio Coelho M, Pascal M, Tobias A, Alahmad B, Abrutzky R, Saldiva P, Correa P, Orteg N, Kan H, Osorio S, Indermitte E, Jaakkola J, Ryti N, Schneider A, Huber V, Katsouyanni K, Analitis A, Entezari A, Mayvaneh F, Michelozzi P, de’Donato F, Hashizume M, Kim Y, Diaz M, De la Cruz Valencia C, Overcenco A, Houthuijs D, Ameling C, Rao S, Seposo X, Nunes B, Holobaca I, Kim H, Lee W, Íñiguez C, Forsberg B, Åström C, Ragettli M, Guo Y, Chen B, Colistro V, Zanobetti A, Schwartz J, Dang T, Van Dung D, Guo Y, Vicedo-Cabrera A, Gasparrini A (2022). Comparison of weather station and climate reanalysis data for modelling temperaturerelated mortality. Scientific Reports , vol. 12, art.  no. 5178. 10.1038/s41598-022-09049-4. \n\n\nEpidemiological analyses of health risks associated with non-optimal temperature are traditionally based on ground observations from weather stations that offer limited spatial and temporal coverage. Climate reanalysis represents an alternative option that provide complete spatio-temporal exposure coverage, and yet are to be systematically explored for their suitability in assessing temperature-related health risks at a global scale. Here we provide the first comprehensive analysis over multiple regions to assess the suitability of the most recent generation of reanalysis datasets for health impact assessments and evaluate their comparative performance against traditional station-based data. Our findings show that reanalysis temperature from the last ERA5 products generally compare well to station observations, with similar non-optimal temperature-related risk estimates. However, the analysis offers some indication of lower performance in tropical regions, with a likely underestimation of heat-related excess mortality. Reanalysis data represent a valid alternative source of exposure variables in epidemiological analyses of temperature-related risk. temperature-related mortality weather stations climate reanalysis health impact assessment data comparison\n\n\ntemperature-related mortalityweather stationsclimate reanalysishealth impact assessmentdata comparison\n\n\n\n\n\nWu Y, Wen B, Li S, Gasparrini A, Tong S, Overcenco A, Urban A, Schneider A, Entezari A, Vicedo-Cabrera A, Zanobetti A, Analitis A, Zeka A, Tobias A, Alahmad B, Armstrong B, Forsberg B, Íñiguez C, Ameling C, De la Cruz Valencia C, Åström C, Houthuijs D, Van Dung D, Royé D, Indermitte E, Lavigne E, Mayvaneh F, Acquaotta F, de’Donato F, Sera F, Carrasco-Escobar G, Kan H, Orru H, Kim H, Holobaca I, Kyselý J, Madureira J, Schwartz J, Katsouyanni K, Hurtado-Diaz M, Ragettli M, Hashizume M, Pascal M, de Sousa Zanotti Stagliorio Coélho M, Scovronick N, Michelozzi P, Goodman P, Nascimento Saldiva P, Abrutzky R, Osorio S, Dang T, Colistro V, Huber V, Lee W, Seposo X, Honda Y, Bell M, Guo Y (2022). Fluctuating temperature modifies heatmortality association around the globe. The Innovation , vol. 3(2), art.  no. 100225. 10.1016/j.xinn.2022.100225. \n\n\nStudies have investigated the effects of heat and temperature variability (TV) on mortality. However, few assessed whether TV modifies the heat-mortality association. Data on daily temperature and mortality in the warm season were collected from 717 locations across 36 countries. TV was calculated as the standard deviation of the average of the same and previous days’ minimum and maximum temperatures. We used location-specific quasi-Poisson regression models with an interaction term between the cross-basis term for mean temperature and quartiles of TV to obtain heat-mortality associations under each quartile of TV, and then pooled estimates at the country, regional, and global levels. Results show the increased risk in heat-related mortality with increments in TV, accounting for 0.70% (95% confidence interval [CI]: −0.33 to 1.69), 1.34% (95% CI: −0.14 to 2.73), 1.99% (95% CI: 0.29–3.57), and 2.73% (95% CI: 0.76–4.50) of total deaths for Q1–Q4 (first quartile–fourth quartile) of TV. The modification effects of TV varied geographically. Central Europe had the highest attributable fractions (AFs), corresponding to 7.68% (95% CI: 5.25–9.89) of total deaths for Q4 of TV, while the lowest AFs were observed in North America, with the values for Q4 of 1.74% (95% CI: −0.09 to 3.39). TV had a significant modification effect on the heat-mortality association, causing a higher heat-related mortality burden with increments of TV. Implementing targeted strategies against heat exposure and fluctuant temperatures simultaneously would benefit public health. temperature variability heat modification effect mortality\n\n\ntemperature variabilityheatmodification effectmortality\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2021\n\n\n\nRoyé D, Tobías A, Figueiras A, Gestal S, Taracido M, Santurtun A, Iñiguez C (2021). Temperature related effects on respiratory medical prescriptions in Spain. Environmental Research , vol. 202, art.  no. 111695. 10.1016/j.envres.2021.111695. \n\n\nBackground. The increased risk of mortality during periods of high and low temperatures has been well established. However, most of the studies used daily counts of deaths or hospitalisations as health outcomes, although they are the ones at the top of the health impact pyramid reflecting only a limited proportion of patients with the most severe cases. Objectives. This study evaluates the relationship between short-term exposure to the daily mean temperature and medication prescribed for the respiratory system in five Spanish cities. Methods. We fitted time series regression models to cause-specific medical prescriptions, including different respiratory subgroups and age groups. We included a distributed lag non-linear model with lags up to 14 days for daily mean temperature. City-specific associations were summarised as overall-cumulative exposure-response curves. Results. We found a positive association between cause-specific medical prescriptions and daily mean temperature with a non-linear inverted J- or V-shaped relationship in most cities. Between 0.3% and 0.6% of all respiratory prescriptions were attributed to cold for Madrid, Zaragoza and Pamplona, while in cities with only cold effects the attributable fractions were estimated as 19.2% for Murcia and 13.5% for Santander. Heat effects in Madrid, Zaragoza and Pamplona showed higher fractions between 8.7% and 17.2%. The estimated costs are in general higher for heat effects, showing annual values ranging between €191,905 and €311,076 for heat per 100,000 persons. Conclusions. This study provides novel evidence of the effects of the thermal environment on the prescription of medication for respiratory disorders in Spain, showing that low and high temperatures lead to an increase in the number of such prescriptions. The consumption of medication can reflect exposure to the environment with a lesser degree of severity in terms of morbidity. medical prescriptions temperature respiratory exposure spain drugs\n\n\nmedical prescriptionstemperaturerespiratoryexposurespaindrugs\n\n\n\n\n\nSera F, Armstrong B, Abbott S, Meakin S, O’Reilly K, von Borries R, Schneider R, Royé D, Hashizume M, Pascal M, Tobias A, Vicedo-Cabrera A, Hu W, Tong S, Lavigne E, Correa P, Meng X, Kan H, Kynčl J, Urban A, Orru H, Ryti N, Jaakkola J, Cauchemez S, Dallavalle M, Schneider A, Zeka A, Honda Y, Ng C, Alahmad B, Rao S, Di Ruscio F, Carrasco-Escobar G, Seposo X, Holobâcă I, Kim H, Lee W, Íñiguez C, Ragettli M, Aleman A, Colistro V, Bell M, Zanobetti A, Schwartz J, Dang T, Scovronick N, de Sousa Zanotti Stagliorio Coélho M, Diaz M, Zhang Y, Russell T, Koltai M, Kucharski A, Barnard R, Quaife M, Jarvis C, Lei J, Munday J, Chan Y, Quilty B, Eggo R, Flasche S, Foss A, Clifford S, Tully D, Edmunds W, Klepac P, Brady O, Krauer F, Procter S, Jombart T, Rosello A, Showering A, Funk S, Hellewell J, Sun F, Endo A, Williams J, Gimma A, Waterlow N, Prem K, Bosse N, Gibbs H, Atkins K, Pearson C, Jafari Y, Villabona-Arenas C, Jit M, Nightingale E, Davies N, van Zandvoort K, Liu Y, Sandmann F, Waites W, Abbas K, Medley G, Knight G, Gasparrini A, Lowe R (2021). A crosssectional analysis of meteorological factors and SARSCoV2 transmission in 409 cities across 26 countries. Nature Communications , vol. 12, art.  no. 5968. 10.1038/s41467-021-25914-8. \n\n\nThere is conflicting evidence on the influence of weather on COVID-19 transmission. Our aim is to estimate weather-dependent signatures in the early phase of the pandemic, while controlling for socio-economic factors and non-pharmaceutical interventions. We identify a modest non-linear association between mean temperature and the effective reproduction number (Re) in 409 cities in 26 countries, with a decrease of 0.087 (95% CI: 0.025; 0.148) for a 10 °C increase. Early interventions have a greater effect on Re with a decrease of 0.285 (95% CI 0.223; 0.347) for a 5th - 95th percentile increase in the government response index. The variation in the effective reproduction number explained by government interventions is 6 times greater than for mean temperature. We find little evidence of meteorological conditions having influenced the early stages of local epidemics and conclude that population behaviour and government interventions are more important drivers of transmission. sars-cov-2 transmission meteorological factors temperature non-pharmaceutical interventions global analysis\n\n\nsars-cov-2 transmissionmeteorological factorstemperaturenon-pharmaceutical interventionsglobal analysis\n\n\n\n\n\nTobías A, Hashizume M, Honda Y, Sera F, Ng C, Kim Y, Royé D, Chung Y, Dang T, Kim H, Lee W, Íñiguez C, Vicedo-Cabrera A, Abrutzky R, Guo Y, Tong S, Coelho M, Saldiva P, Lavigne E, Correa P, Ortega N, Kan H, Osorio S, Kyselý J, Urban A, Orru H, Indermitte E, Jaakkola J, Ryti N, Pascal M, Huber V, Schneider A, Katsouyanni K, Analitis A, Entezari A, Mayvaneh F, Goodman P, Zeka A, Michelozzi P, de’Donato F, Alahmad B, Diaz M, De la Cruz Valencia C, Overcenco A, Houthuijs D, Ameling C, Rao S, Di Ruscio F, Carrasco G, Seposo X, Nunes B, Madureira J, Holobaca I, Scovronick N, Acquaotta F, Forsberg B, Åström C, Ragettli M, Guo Y, Chen B, Li S, Colistro V, Zanobetti A, Schwartz J, Dung D, Armstrong B, Gasparrini A (2021). Geographical Variations of the Minimum Mortality Temperature at a Global Scale. Environmental Epidemiology , vol. 5(5), art.  no. e169. 10.1097/EE9.0000000000000169. \n\n\nBackground: Minimum mortality temperature (MMT) is an important indicator to assess the temperature-mortality association, indicating long-term adaptation to local climate. Limited evidence about the geographical variability of the MMT is available at a global scale. Methods: We collected data from 658 communities in 43 countries under different climates. We estimated temperature-mortality associations to derive the MMT for each community using Poisson regression with distributed lag nonlinear models. We investigated the variation in MMT by climatic zone using a mixed-effects meta-analysis and explored the association with climatic and socioeconomic indicators. Results: The geographical distribution of MMTs varied considerably by country between 14.2 and 31.1 °C decreasing by latitude. For climatic zones, the MMTs increased from alpine (13.0 °C) to continental (19.3 °C), temperate (21.7 °C), arid (24.5 °C), and tropical (26.5 °C). The MMT percentiles (MMTPs) corresponding to the MMTs decreased from temperate (79.5th) to continental (75.4th), arid (68.0th), tropical (58.5th), and alpine (41.4th). The MMTs indreased by 0.8 °C for a 1 °C rise in a community’s annual mean temperature, and by 1 °C for a 1 °C rise in its SD. While the MMTP decreased by 0.3 centile points for a 1 °C rise in a community’s annual mean temperature and by 1.3 for a 1 °C rise in its SD. Conclusions: The geographical distribution of the MMTs and MMTPs is driven mainly by the mean annual temperature, which seems to be a valuable indicator of overall adaptation across populations. Our results suggest that populations have adapted to the average temperature, although there is still more room for adaptation. adaptation climate distributed lag nonlinear models minimum mortality temperature multi-city multi-country time-series\n\n\nadaptationclimatedistributed lag nonlinear modelsminimum mortality temperaturemulti-citymulti-countrytime-series\n\n\n\n\n\nChen G, Guo Y, Yue X, Tong S, Gasparrini A, Bell M, Armstrong B, Schwartz J, Jaakkola J, Zanobetti A, Lavigne E, Nascimento Saldiva P, Kan H, Royé D, Milojevic A, Overcenco A, Urban A, Schneider A, Entezari A, Vicedo-Cabrera A, Zeka A, Tobias A, Nunes B, Alahmad B, Forsberg B, Pan S, Íñiguez C, Ameling C, De la Cruz Valencia C, Åström C, Houthuijs D, Van Dung D, Samoli E, Mayvaneh F, Sera F, Carrasco-Escobar G, Lei Y, Orru H, Kim H, Holobaca I, Kyselý J, Teixeira J, Madureira J, Katsouyanni K, Hurtado-Díaz M, Maasikmets M, Ragettli M, Hashizume M, Stafoggia M, Pascal M, Scortichini M, de Sousa Zanotti Stagliorio Coêlho M, Valdés Ortega N, Ryti N, Scovronick N, Matus P, Goodman P, Garland R, Abrutzky R, Garcia S, Rao S, Fratianni S, Dang T, Colistro V, Huber V, Lee W, Seposo X, Honda Y, Guo Y, Ye T, Yu W, Abramson M, Samet J, Li S (2021). Mortality risk attributable to wildfire related PM2·5 pollution: a global time series study in 749 locations. The Lancet Planetary Health , vol. 5(9), pp. e579-e587.  10.1016/S2542-5196(21)00200-X. \n\n\nackground. Many regions of the world are now facing more frequent and unprecedentedly large wildfires. However, the association between wildfire-related PM2·5 and mortality has not been well characterised. We aimed to comprehensively assess the association between short-term exposure to wildfire-related PM2·5 and mortality across various regions of the world. Methods. For this time series study, data on daily counts of deaths for all causes, cardiovascular causes, and respiratory causes were collected from 749 cities in 43 countries and regions during 2000–16. Daily concentrations of wildfire-related PM2·5 were estimated using the three-dimensional chemical transport model GEOS-Chem at a 0·25° × 0·25° resolution. The association between wildfire-related PM2·5 exposure and mortality was examined using a quasi-Poisson time series model in each city considering both the current-day and lag effects, and the effect estimates were then pooled using a random-effects meta-analysis. Based on these pooled effect estimates, the population attributable fraction and relative risk (RR) of annual mortality due to acute wildfire-related PM2·5 exposure was calculated. Findings. 65·6 million all-cause deaths, 15·1 million cardiovascular deaths, and 6·8 million respiratory deaths were included in our analyses. The pooled RRs of mortality associated with each 10 μg/m3 increase in the 3-day moving average (lag 0–2 days) of wildfire-related PM2·5 exposure were 1·019 (95% CI 1·016–1·022) for all-cause mortality, 1·017 (1·012–1·021) for cardiovascular mortality, and 1·019 (1·013–1·025) for respiratory mortality. Overall, 0·62% (95% CI 0·48–0·75) of all-cause deaths, 0·55% (0·43–0·67) of cardiovascular deaths, and 0·64% (0·50–0·78) of respiratory deaths were annually attributable to the acute impacts of wildfire-related PM2·5 exposure during the study period. Interpretation. Short-term exposure to wildfire-related PM2·5 was associated with increased risk of mortality. Urgent action is needed to reduce health risks from the increasing wildfires. wildfire-related pm2.5 mortality risk global analysis cardiovascular mortality respiratory mortality\n\n\nwildfire-related pm2.5mortality riskglobal analysiscardiovascular mortalityrespiratory mortality\n\n\n\n\n\nLorenzo N, Díaz-Poso A, Royé D (2021). Heatwave intensity on the Iberian Peninsula: Future climate projections. Atmospheric Research , vol. 258(15), art.  no. 105655. 10.1016/j.atmosres.2021.105655. \n\n\nHeatwaves are the most relevant extreme climatic events, particularly in the context of global warming and the related increasing impacts on society and the natural environment. This work presents an analysis of climate change scenarios with simulations from the EURO-CORDEX project using the excess heat factor over the Iberian Peninsula. We focus on climate change projections of the heatwave intensity and spatial distribution, which are evaluated for the near future (2021–2050) relative to a reference past climate (1971–2000). Heatwave projections show a general significant increase in intensity, frequency, duration and spatial extent for the whole region. The average change in heatwave intensity is 104% for the whole Iberian Peninsula for the near future 2021–2050. The largest changes occur in the eastern-central region, rising to 150% for the Mediterranean coast and the Pyrenees. The greater spatial extent of heatwaves strongly suggests increased human exposure, increased energy demand, and implications for fire risk. This spatial trend is predicted to continue in the near future with increases in the maximum spatial heatwave extent ranging from 6% to 8% per decade. heatwaves climate change iberian peninsula temperature projections extreme weather\n\n\nheatwavesclimate changeiberian peninsulatemperature projectionsextreme weather\n\n\n\n\n\nMathbout S, Lopez-Bustins J, Royé D, Martin-Vide J (2021). Mediterranean Scale Drought: Regional Datasets for Exceptional Meteorological Drought Events during 1975–2019. Atmosphere , vol. 12(8), art.  no. 941. 10.3390/atmos12080941. \n\n\nDrought is one of the most complex climate-related phenomena and is expected to progressively affect our lives by causing very serious environmental and socioeconomic damage by the end of the 21st century. In this study, we have extracted a dataset of exceptional meteorological drought events between 1975 and 2019 at the country and subregional scales. Each drought event was described by its start and end date, intensity, severity, duration, areal extent, peak month and peak area. To define such drought events and their characteristics, separate analyses based on three drought indices were performed at 12-month timescale: the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), and the Reconnaissance Drought Index (RDI). A multivariate combined drought index (DXI) was developed by merging the previous three indices for more understanding of droughts’ features at the country and subregional levels. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to identify five different drought subregions based on DXI-12 values for 312 Mediterranean stations and a new special score was defined to classify the multi-subregional exceptional drought events across the Mediterranean Basin (MED). The results indicated that extensive drought events occurred more frequently since the late 1990s, showing several drought hotspots in the last decades in the southeastern Mediterranean and northwest Africa. In addition, the results showed that the most severe events were more detected when more than single drought index was used. The highest percentage area under drought was also observed through combining the variations of three drought indices. Furthermore, the drought area in both dry and humid areas in the MED has also experienced a remarkable increase since the late 1990s. Based on a comparison of the drought events during the two periods—1975–1996 and 1997–2019—we find that the current dry conditions in the MED are more severe, intense, and frequent than the earlier period; moreover, the strongest dry conditions occurred in last two decades. The SPEI-12 and RDI-12 have a higher capacity in providing a more comprehensive description of the dry conditions because of the inclusion of temperature or atmospheric evaporative demand in their scheme. A complex range of atmospheric circulation patterns, particularly the Western Mediterranean Oscillation (WeMO) and East Atlantic/West Russia (EATL/WRUS), appear to play an important role in severe, intense and region-wide droughts, including the two most severe droughts, 1999–2001 and 2007–2012, with lesser influence of the NAO, ULMO and SCAND. climate change drought event mediterranean basin meteorological drought spei spi rdi dxi\n\n\nclimate changedrought eventmediterranean basinmeteorological droughtspeispirdidxi\n\n\n\n\n\nMartí Ezpeleta A, Royé D (2021). Intensidad y duración del estrés térmico en verano en el área urbana de Madrid. Geographicalia , vol. 73.  10.26754/ojs_geoph/geoph.2021735202. \n\n\nEn este trabajo se aplica una metodología nueva al estudio de las noches calurosas, también denominadas “tropicales”, en el área metropolitana de Madrid, de cara a evaluar desde una perspectiva temporal y espacial aquellas noches en las que la población pueda verse afectada por estrés térmico. La utilización de dos indicadores obtenidos a través de datos horarios, junto a la información climática suministrada por el modelo UrbClim, ha permitido conocer a una escala de detalle las características térmicas de las noches del mes de julio entre 2008 y 2017, pudiendo así evaluar con más precisión el riesgo para el bienestar y la salud de la población. Los resultados muestran una gran variabilidad interurbana en cuanto a intensidad y duración del estrés térmico, así como una correlación significativa entre las intensidades de la isla de calor y los índices de exceso de calor. Asimismo se ha comprobado la existencia de una estrecha relación entre las tipologías de usos del suelo y estructuras urbanas definidas en el Urban Atlas, y los índices de exceso de calor nocturno. noche calurosa estrés térmico isla de calor urbclim madrid\n\n\nnoche calurosaestrés térmicoisla de calorurbclimmadrid\n\n\n\n\n\nZhao Q, Guo Y, Ye T, Gasparrini A, Tong S, Overcenco A, Urban A, Schneider A, Entezari A, Vicedo-Cabrera A, Zanobetti A, Analitis A, Zeka A, Tobias A, Nunes B, Alahmad B, Armstrong B, Forsberg B, Pan S, Íñiguez C, Ameling C, De la Cruz Valencia C, Åström C, Houthuijs D, Dung D, Royé D, Indermitte E, Lavigne E, Mayvaneh F, Acquaotta F, de’Donato F, Di Ruscio F, Sera F, Carrasco-Escobar G, Kan H, Orru H, Kim H, Holobaca I, Kyselý J, Madureira J, Schwartz J, Jaakkola J, Katsouyanni K, Hurtado Diaz M, Ragettli M, Hashizume M, Pascal M, de Sousa Zanotti Stagliorio Coélho M, Valdés Ortega N, Ryti N, Scovronick N, Michelozzi P, Matus Correa P, Goodman P, Nascimento Saldiva P, Abrutzky R, Osorio S, Rao S, Fratianni S, Dang T, Colistro V, Huber V, Lee W, Seposo X, Honda Y, Guo Y, Bell M, Li S (2021). Global, regional, and national burden of mortality associated with nonoptimal ambient temperatures from 2000 to 2019: a threestage modelling study. The Lancet Planetary Health , vol. 5(7), pp. e415-e425.  10.1016/S2542-5196(21)00081-4. \n\n\nBackground. Exposure to cold or hot temperatures is associated with premature deaths. We aimed to evaluate the global, regional, and national mortality burden associated with non-optimal ambient temperatures. Methods. In this modelling study, we collected time-series data on mortality and ambient temperatures from 750 locations in 43 countries and five meta-predictors at a grid size of 0·5° × 0·5° across the globe. A three-stage analysis strategy was used. First, the temperature–mortality association was fitted for each location by use of a time-series regression. Second, a multivariate meta-regression model was built between location-specific estimates and meta-predictors. Finally, the grid-specific temperature–mortality association between 2000 and 2019 was predicted by use of the fitted meta-regression and the grid-specific meta-predictors. Excess deaths due to non-optimal temperatures, the ratio between annual excess deaths and all deaths of a year (the excess death ratio), and the death rate per 100 000 residents were then calculated for each grid across the world. Grids were divided according to regional groupings of the UN Statistics Division. Findings. Globally, 5 083 173 deaths (95% empirical CI [eCI] 4 087 967–5 965 520) were associated with non-optimal temperatures per year, accounting for 9·43% (95% eCI 7·58–11·07) of all deaths (8·52% [6·19–10·47] were cold-related and 0·91% [0·56–1·36] were heat-related). There were 74 temperature-related excess deaths per 100 000 residents (95% eCI 60–87). The mortality burden varied geographically. Of all excess deaths, 2 617 322 (51·49%) occurred in Asia. Eastern Europe had the highest heat-related excess death rate and Sub-Saharan Africa had the highest cold-related excess death rate. From 2000–03 to 2016–19, the global cold-related excess death ratio changed by −0·51 percentage points (95% eCI −0·61 to −0·42) and the global heat-related excess death ratio increased by 0·21 percentage points (0·13–0·31), leading to a net reduction in the overall ratio. The largest decline in overall excess death ratio occurred in South-eastern Asia, whereas excess death ratio fluctuated in Southern Asia and Europe. Interpretation. Non-optimal temperatures are associated with a substantial mortality burden, which varies spatiotemporally. Our findings will benefit international, national, and local communities in developing preparedness and prevention strategies to reduce weather-related impacts immediately and under climate change scenarios. mortality burden non-optimal temperatures climate change global analysis public health\n\n\nmortality burdennon-optimal temperaturesclimate changeglobal analysispublic health\n\n\n\n\n\nWright B, Laffineur B, Royé D, Armstrong G, Fensham R (2021). Rainfall Linked Megafires as Innate Fire Regime Elements in Arid Australian Spinifex (Triodia spp.) Grasslands. Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution , vol. 9.  10.3389/fevo.2021.666241. \n\n\nLarge, high-severity wildfires, or “megafires,” occur periodically in arid Australian spinifex (Triodia spp.) grasslands after high rainfall periods that trigger fuel accumulation. Proponents of the patch-burn mosaic (PBM) hypothesis suggest that these fires are unprecedented in the modern era and were formerly constrained by Aboriginal patch burning that kept landscape fuel levels low. This assumption deserves scrutiny, as evidence from fire-prone systems globally indicates that weather factors are the primary determinant behind megafire incidence, and that fuel management does not mitigate such fires during periods of climatic extreme. We reviewed explorer’s diaries, anthropologist’s reports, and remotely sensed data from the Australian Western Desert for evidence of large rainfall-linked fires during the pre-contact period when traditional Aboriginal patch burning was still being practiced. We used only observations that contained empiric estimates of fire sizes. Concurrently, we employed remote rainfall data and the Oceanic Niño Index to relate fire size to likely seasonal conditions at the time the observations were made. Numerous records were found of small fires during periods of average and below-average rainfall conditions, but no evidence of large-scale fires during these times. By contrast, there was strong evidence of large-scale wildfires during a high-rainfall period in the early 1870s, some of which are estimated to have burnt areas up to 700,000 ha. Our literature review also identified several Western Desert Aboriginal mythologies that refer to large-scale conflagrations. As oral traditions sometimes corroborate historic events, these myths may add further evidence that large fires are an inherent feature of spinifex grassland fire regimes. Overall, the results suggest that, contrary to predictions of the PBM hypothesis, traditional Aboriginal burning did not modulate spinifex fire size during periods of extreme-high arid zone rainfall. The mechanism behind this is that plant assemblages in seral spinifex vegetation comprise highly flammable non-spinifex tussock grasses that rapidly accumulate high fuel loads under favorable precipitation conditions. Our finding that fuel management does not prevent megafires under extreme conditions in arid Australia has parallels with the primacy of climatic factors as drivers of megafires in the forests of temperate Australia. megafires rainfall spinifex grasslands fire regimes aboriginal burning\n\n\nmegafiresrainfallspinifex grasslandsfire regimesaboriginal burning\n\n\n\n\n\nVicedo-Cabrera A M, Scovronick N, Sera F, Royé D, Schneider R, Tobias A, Astrom C, Guo Y, Honda Y, Hondula D M, Abrutzky R, Tong S, Coelho M de Sousa Zanotti Stagliorio, Saldiva P H Nascimento, Lavigne E, Correa P Matus, Ortega N Valdes, Kan H, Osorio S, Kyselý J, Urban A, Orru H, Indermitte E, Jaakkola J J K, Ryti N, Pascal M, Schneider A, Katsouyanni K, Samoli E, Mayvaneh F, Entezari A, Goodman P, Zeka A, Michelozzi P, de’Donato F, Hashizume M, Alahmad B, Diaz M Hurtado, Valencia C De La Cruz, Overcenco A, Houthuijs D, Ameling C, Rao S, Di Ruscio F, Carrasco-Escobar G, Seposo X, Silva S, Madureira J, Holobaca I H, Fratianni S, Acquaotta F, Kim H, Lee W, Iniguez C, Forsberg B, Ragettli M S, Guo Y L L, Chen B Y, Li S, Armstrong B, Aleman A, Zanobetti A, Schwartz J, Dang T N, Dung D V, Gillett N, Haines A, Mengel M, Huber V, Gasparrini A (2021). The burden of heatrelated mortality attributable to recent humaninduced climate change. Nature Climate Change , vol. 11, pp. 492-500.  10.1038/s41558-021-01058-x. \n\n\nClimate change affects human health; however, there have been no large-scale, systematic efforts to quantify the heat-related human health impacts that have already occurred due to climate change. Here, we use empirical data from 732 locations in 43 countries to estimate the mortality burdens associated with the additional heat exposure that has resulted from recent human-induced warming, during the period 1991–2018. Across all study countries, we find that 37.0% (range 20.5–76.3%) of warm-season heat-related deaths can be attributed to anthropogenic climate change and that increased mortality is evident on every continent. Burdens varied geographically but were of the order of dozens to hundreds of deaths per year in many locations. Our findings support the urgent need for more ambitious mitigation and adaptation strategies to minimize the public health impacts of climate change. heat-related mortality climate change anthropogenic warming global analysis public health\n\n\nheat-related mortalityclimate changeanthropogenic warmingglobal analysispublic health\n\n\n\n\n\nde Schrijver E, Folly C, Schneider R, Royé D, Franco O, Gasparrini A, Vicedo‐Cabrera A (2021). A Comparative Analysis of the Temperature‐Mortality Risks Using Different Weather Datasets Across Heterogeneous Regions. GeoHealth , vol. 5(5. https://doi.org/10.1029/2020GH000363 \n\n\nNew gridded climate datasets (GCDs) on spatially resolved modeled weather data have recently been released to explore the impacts of climate change. GCDs have been suggested as potential alternatives to weather station data in epidemiological assessments on health impacts of temperature and climate change. These can be particularly useful for assessment in regions that have remained understudied due to limited or low quality weather station data. However to date, no study has critically evaluated the application of GCDs of variable spatial resolution in temperature-mortality assessments across regions of different orography, climate, and size. Here we explored the performance of population-weighted daily mean temperature data from the global ERA5 reanalysis dataset in the 10 regions in the United Kingdom and the 26 cantons in Switzerland, combined with two local high-resolution GCDs (HadUK-grid UKPOC-9 and MeteoSwiss-grid-product, respectively) and compared these to weather station data and unweighted homologous series. We applied quasi-Poisson time series regression with distributed lag nonlinear models to obtain the GCD- and region-specific temperature-mortality associations and calculated the corresponding cold- and heat-related excess mortality. Although the five exposure datasets yielded different average area-level temperature estimates, these deviations did not result in substantial variations in the temperature-mortality association or impacts. Moreover, local population-weighted GCDs showed better overall performance, suggesting that they could be excellent alternatives to help advance knowledge on climate change impacts in remote regions with large climate and population distribution variability, which has remained largely unexplored in present literature due to the lack of reliable exposure data. temperature-related mortality weather datasets heterogeneous regions climate data health impact assessment\n\n\ntemperature-related mortalityweather datasetsheterogeneous regionsclimate datahealth impact assessment\n\n\n\n\n\nRoyé D, Sera F, Tobías A, Lowe R, Gasparrini A, Pascal M, de’Donato F, Nunes B, Teixeira J (2021). Effects of Hot Nights on Mortality in Southern Europe. Epidemiology , vol. 32(4), pp. 487-498.  10.1097/ede.0000000000001359. \n\n\nBackground: There is strong evidence concerning the impact of heat stress on mortality, particularly from high temperatures. However, few studies to our knowledge emphasize the importance of hot nights, which may prevent necessary nocturnal rest. Objectives: In this study, we use hot-night duration and excess to predict daily cause-specific mortality in summer, using multiple cities across Southern Europe. Methods: We fitted time series regression models to summer cause-specific mortality, including natural, respiratory, and cardiovascular causes, in 11 cities across four countries. We included a distributed lag nonlinear model with lags up to 7 days for hot night duration and excess adjusted by daily mean temperature. We summarized city-specific associations as overall-cumulative exposure–response curves at the country level using meta-analysis. Results: We found positive but generally nonlinear associations between relative risk (RR) of cause-specific mortality and duration and excess of hot nights. RR of duration associated with nonaccidental mortality in Portugal was 1.29 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.07, 1.54); other associations were imprecise, but we also found positive city-specific estimates for Rome and Madrid. Risk of hot-night excess ranged from 1.12 (95% CI = 1.05, 1.20) for France to 1.37 (95% CI = 1.26, 1.48) for Portugal. Risk estimates for excess were consistently higher than for duration. Conclusions: This study provides new evidence that, over a wider range of locations, hot night indices are strongly associated with cause-specific deaths. Modeling the impact of thermal characteristics during summer nights on mortality could improve decisionmaking for preventive public health strategies. hot nights mortality southern europe heat stress public health\n\n\nhot nightsmortalitysouthern europeheat stresspublic health\n\n\n\n\n\nFdez-Arróyabe P, Marti-Ezpeleta A, Royé D, Zarrabeitia A (2021). Effects of circulation weather types on influenza hospital admissions in Spain. International Journal of Biometeorology , vol. 65.  10.1007/s00484-021-02107-y. \n\n\nIn this study, we use a statistical approach based on generalized additive models, linking atmospheric circulation and the number of influenza-related hospital admissions in the Spanish Iberian Peninsula during 2003–2013. The relative risks are estimated for administrative units in the Spanish territory, which is politically structured into 15 regions called autonomous communities. A catalog of atmospheric circulation types is defined for this purpose. The relationship between the exposure and response variables is modeled using a distributed lag nonlinear model (DLNM). Types from southwest and anticyclonic are significant in terms of the probability of having more influenza-related hospital admissions for all of Spain. The heterogeneity of the results is very high. The relative risk is also estimated for each autonomous community and weather type, with the maximum number of influenza-related hospital admissions associated with circulation types from the southwest and the south. We identify six specific situations where relative risk is considered extreme and twelve with a high risk of increasing influenza-related hospital admissions. The rest of the situations present a moderate risk. Atmospheric local conditions become a key factor for understanding influenza spread in each spatial unit of the Peninsula. Further research is needed to understand how different weather variables (temperature, humidity, and sun radiation) interact and promote the spread of influenza. influenza atmospheric circulation hospital admissions spain weather types\n\n\ninfluenzaatmospheric circulationhospital admissionsspainweather types\n\n\n\n\n\nIñiguez C, Royé D, Tobías A (2021). Contrasting patterns of temperature related mortality and hospitalization by cardiovascular and respiratory diseases in 52 Spanish cities. Environmental Research , vol. 192, art.  no. 110191. 10.1016/j.envres.2020.110191. \n\n\nBackground. Climate change is a severe public health challenge. Understanding to what extent fatal and non-fatal consequences of specific diseases are associated with temperature may help to improve the effectiveness of preventive public health efforts. This study examines the effects of temperature on deaths and hospital admissions by cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, empathizing the difference between mortality and morbidity. Methods. Daily counts for mortality and hospital admissions by cardiovascular and respiratory diseases were collected for the 52 provincial capital cities in Spain, between 1990 and 2014. The association with temperature in each city was investigated by means of distributed lag non-linear models using quasi-Poisson regression. City-specific exposure-response curves were pooled by multivariate random-effects meta-analysis to obtain countrywide risk estimates of mortality and hospitalizations due to heat and cold, and attributable fractions were computed. Results. Heat and cold exposure were identified to be associated with increased risk of cardiovascular and respiratory mortality. Heat was not found to have an impact on hospital admissions. The estimated fraction of mortality attributable to cold was of greater magnitude in hospitalizations (17.5% for cardiovascular and 12.5% for respiratory diseases) compared to deaths (9% and 2.7%, respectively). Conclusions. There were noteworthy differences between temperature-related mortality and hospital admissions regarding cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, hence reinforcing the convenience of cause-specific measures to prevent temperature-related deaths. temperature-related mortality hospital admissions cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases spain\n\n\ntemperature-related mortalityhospital admissionscardiovascular diseasesrespiratory diseasesspain\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2020\n\n\n\nRomani S, Royé D, Sánchez Santos L, Figueiras A (2020). Impact of Extreme Temperatures on Ambulance Dispatches Due to Cardiovascular Causes in NorthWest Spain. International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health , vol. 17(23), art.  no. 9001. 10.3390/ijerph17239001. \n\n\nIntroduction and objectives. The increase in mortality and hospital admissions associated with high and low temperatures is well established. However, less is known about the influence of extreme ambient temperature conditions on cardiovascular ambulance dispatches. This study seeks to evaluate the effects of minimum and maximum daily temperatures on cardiovascular morbidity in the cities of Vigo and A Coruña in North-West Spain, using emergency medical calls during the period 2005–2017. Methods. For the purposes of analysis, we employed a quasi-Poisson time series regression model, within a distributed non-linear lag model by exposure variable and city. The relative risks of cold- and heat-related calls were estimated for each city and temperature model. Results. A total of 70,537 calls were evaluated, most of which were associated with low maximum and minimum temperatures on cold days in both cities. At maximum temperatures, significant cold-related effects were observed at lags of 3–6 days in Vigo and 5–11 days in A Coruña. At minimum temperatures, cold-related effects registered a similar pattern in both cities, with significant relative risks at lags of 4 to 12 days in A Coruña. Heat-related effects did not display a clearly significant pattern. Conclusions. An increase in cardiovascular morbidity is observed with moderately low temperatures without extremes being required to establish an effect. Public health prevention plans and warning systems should consider including moderate temperature range in the prevention of cardiovascular morbidity. ambulance dispatches extreme temperature galicia cardiovascular diseases quasi-poisson regression model\n\n\nambulance dispatchesextreme temperaturegaliciacardiovascular diseasesquasi-poisson regression model\n\n\n\n\n\nFdez-Arroyabe P, Kourtidis K, Haldoupis C, Savoska S, Matthews J, Mir L, Kassomenos P, Cifra M, Barbosa S, Chen X, Dragovic S, Consoulas C, Hunting E, Robert D, van der Velde O, Apollonio F, Odzimek A, Chilingarian A, Royé D, Mkrtchyan H, Price C, Bór J, Oikonomou C, Birsan M, Crespo-Facorro B, Djordjevic M, Salcines C, López-Jiménez A, Donner R, Vana M, Pedersen J, Vorenhout M, Rycroft M (2020).

International Journal of Biometeorology , vol. 65, pp. 5-29.  10.1007/s00484-020-02013-9. \n\n\nThere is an increasing interest to study the interactions between atmospheric electrical parameters and living organisms at multiple scales. So far, relatively few studies have been published that focus on possible biological effects of atmospheric electric and magnetic fields. To foster future work in this area of multidisciplinary research, here we present a glossary of relevant terms. Its main purpose is to facilitate the process of learning and communication among the different scientific disciplines working on this topic.

Predictive value of three thermal comfort indices in low temperatures on cardiovascular morbidity in the Iberian peninsula. Science of The Total Environment , vol. 729, art.  no. 138969. 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138969. \n\n\nThe natural environment has been considered an important determinant of cardiovascular morbidity. This work seeks to assess the impact of the winter thermal environment on hospital admissions from diseases of the circulatory system by using three biometeorological indices in five regions of the Iberian Peninsula. A theoretical index based on a thermophysiological model (Universal Thermal Climate Index [UTCI]) and two experimental biometeorological ones (Net Effective Temperature [NET] and Apparent Temperature [AT]) were estimated in two metropolitan areas of Portugal (Porto and Lisbon) and in three provinces of Spain (Madrid, Barcelona and Valencia). Subsequently, their relationship with hospital admissions, adjusted by NO2 concentration, time, and day of the week, was analyzed using a Generalized Additive Model. As the estimation method, a semi-parametric quasi-Poisson regression was used. Around 53% of the hospitalizations occurred during the cold periods. The admissions rate followed an upward trend over the 9-year period in both capitals (Madrid and Lisbon) as well as in Barcelona. An inverse and statistically significant relationship was found between thermal comfort and hospital admissions in the five regions (p  0.001). The highest relative risk (RR) was found after a cumulative 7-day exposure in Lisbon, where there was a 1.4% increase in hospital admissions for each NET and AT degree Celsius, and 1.0% for each UTCI degree Celsius. In conclusion, low air temperatures are a significant risk factor for hospital admissions from diseases of the circulatory system in the Iberian Peninsula, regardless of the index calculated. thermal comfort indices low temperatures cardiovascular morbidity iberian peninsula health impacts\n\n\nthermal comfort indiceslow temperaturescardiovascular morbidityiberian peninsulahealth impacts\n\n\n\n\n\nRoyé D, Íñiguez C, Tobías A (2020). Comparison of temperature–mortality associations using observed weather station and reanalysis data in 52 Spanish cities. Environmental Research , vol. 183, art.  no. 109237. 10.1016/j.envres.2020.109237. \n\n\nBackground. Most studies use temperature observation data from weather stations near the analyzed region or city as the reference point for the exposure-response association. Climatic reanalysis data sets have already been used for climate studies, but are not yet used routinely in environmental epidemiology. Methods. We compared the mortality-temperature association using weather station temperature and ERA-5 reanalysis data for the 52 provincial capital cities in Spain, using time-series regression with distributed lag non-linear models. Results. The shape of temperature distribution is very close between the weather station and ERA-5 reanalysis data (correlation from 0.90 to 0.99). The overall cumulative exposure-response curves are very similar in their shape and risks estimates for cold and heat effects, although risk estimates for ERA-5 were slightly lower than for weather station temperature. Conclusions. Reanalysis data allow the estimation of the health effects of temperature, even in areas located far from weather stations or without any available. temperature-mortality weather stations reanalysis data time-series regression distributed lag non-linear models\n\n\ntemperature-mortalityweather stationsreanalysis datatime-seriesregression distributed lag non-linear models\n\n\n\n\n\nRoyé D, Codesido R, Tobías A, Taracido M (2020). Heat wave intensity and daily mortality in four of the largest cities of Spain. Environmental Research , vol. 182, art.  no. 109027. 10.1016/j.envres.2019.109027. \n\n\nIn the current context of climate change, heat waves have become a significant problem for human health. This study assesses the effects of heat wave intensity on mortality (natural, respiratory and cardiovascular causes) in four of the largest cities of Spain (Barcelona, Bilbao, Madrid and Seville) during the period between 1990 and 2014. To model the heat wave severity the Excess Heat Factor (EHF) was used. The EHF is a two-component index. The first is the comparison of the three-day average daily mean temperature with the 95th percentile. The second component is a measure of the temperatures reached during the three-day period compared with the recent past (the previous 30 days). The city-specific exposure-response curves showed a non-linear J-shaped relationship between mortality and the EHF. Overall city-specific mortality risk estimates in natural causes for 1st vs. 99th percentile increases range from the highest mortality risk with 2.73 (95% CI: 2.34-3.18) in Seville to a risk of 1.78 (95% CI: 1.62-1.97) and 1.78 (95% CI: 1.45-2.19) in Barcelona and Bilbao, respectively. When we compare our results with risk estimates for the analyzed Spanish cities in other studies, the heat wave related mortality risks seem to be clearly higher. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that different heat wave days of the same event do not present the same degree of severity/intensity. Thus, the intensity of a heat wave is an important mortality risk indicator during heat wave days. Due to the low number of studies on the EHF as a heat wave intensity indicator and heat-related mortality and morbidity, further research is required to validate its application in other geographic areas and focus populations. apparent temperature excess heat factor heat effects intensity mortality spain\n\n\napparent temperatureexcess heat factorheat effectsintensitymortalityspain\n\n\n\n\n\nMonjo R, Royé D, Martin-Vide J (2020). Meteorological drought lacunarity around the world and its classification. Earth System Science Data , vol. 12(1), pp. 741-752.  10.5194/essd-12-741-2020. \n\n\nThe measure of drought duration strongly depends on the definition considered. In meteorology, dryness is habitually measured by means of fixed thresholds (e.g. 0.1 or 1 mm usually define dry spells) or climatic mean values (as is the case of the standardised precipitation index), but this also depends on the aggregation time interval considered. However, robust measurements of drought duration are required for analysing the statistical significance of possible changes. Herein we climatically classified the drought duration around the world according to its similarity to the voids of the Cantor set. Dryness time structure can be concisely measured by the n index (from the regular or irregular alternation of dry or wet spells), which is closely related to the Gini index and to a Cantor-based exponent. This enables the world’s climates to be classified into six large types based on a new measure of drought duration. To conclude, outcomes provide the ability to determine when droughts start and finish. We performed the dry-spell analysis using the full global gridded daily Multi-Source Weighted-Ensemble Precipitation (MSWEP) dataset. The MSWEP combines gauge-, satellite-, and reanalysis-based data to provide reliable precipitation estimates. The study period comprises the years 1979–2016 (total of 45 165 d), and a spatial resolution of 0.5∘, with a total of 259 197 grid points.

Alcohol outlet density and alcohol consumption in Galician youth. Gaceta Sanitaria , vol. 34(1), pp. 15-20.  10.1016/j.gaceta.2018.09.005. \n\n\nObjective. To assess the influence that alcohol outlet density, off- and on-alcohol premises, and alcohol consumption wield on the consumption patterns of young pre-university students in Galicia (Spain). Method. A cross-sectional analysis of a cohort of students of the University of Santiago de Compostela (Compostela Cohort 2016) was carried out. Consumption prevalence were calculated for each of the municipalities from the first-cycle students’ home residence during the year prior to admission. The association with risky alcohol consumption (RC) and binge-drinking (BD) was assessed with a logistic model considering as independent variables the municipality population, alcohol outlet density of off- premises, density of off- and on- premises and total density of both types of premises in the municipality. Results. The prevalence of RC was 60.5% (95% confidence interval [95%CI]: 58.4-62.5) and the BD was 28.5% (95%CI: 26.7-30.2). A great variability was observed according to the municipality of provenance. The multivariate logistic model showed municipalities with a density of 8.42-9.34 of both types of premises per thousand inhabitants presented a higher risk of RC (odds ratio [OR]: 1,39; 95%CI: 1.09-1.78) and BD (OR: 1.29; 95%CI: 1.01-1.66). Conclusion. These data suggest the importance of including environmental information when studying alcohol consumption.

Land Degradation & Development , vol. 31(3), pp. 311-324.  10.1002/ldr.3450. \n\n\nThe most widely used metrics to characterize wildfire regime and estimate the impact of wildfires are total burnt area (BA) and the number of fire events (FE). However, these are insufficient to analyse the threat to society of a new fire regime characterized by a higher occurrence of very large events. To overcome this weakness, we propose the use of a Concentration Index (CIB) which makes it possible to identify spatio-temporal patterns. The frequency distribution of BA follows a negative exponential distribution almost everywhere, in which a small minority of FE is responsible of the majority of BA. In this article, the spatio-temporal behaviour of BA is analysed in Western Mediterranean Europe, with particular focus on Portugal, Spain, France and Italy, using data from the European Forest Fire Information System and national wildfire databases. This is the first time that the CI has been applied to wildfire events. This research shows that, in most Mediterranean European countries, the amount of BA is increasingly related with a lower number of fires. The spatio-temporal distribution of CIB shows high variability in all of the countries analysed in Europe. Portugal and Spain show increasing significant trends of CIB + 7.6% (p-value = 0.001) and + 1.3% per decade (p-value = 0.003). Statistically significant correlations for Portugal, Spain and Italy are also found between the annual CIB and several teleconnection indices. The application of the CIB demonstrates its discriminatory ability, which is a key point in detecting vulnerable areas and temporal trends under climate change. burnt area concentration index spatial patterns temporal trends fire regimes\n\n\nburnt areaconcentration indexspatial patternstemporal trendsfire regimes\n\n\n\n\n\nMathbout S, Lopez‐Bustins J, Royé D, Martin‐Vide J, Benhamrouche A (2019). Spatiotemporal variability of daily precipitation concentration and its relationship to teleconnection patterns over the Mediterranean during 1975–2015. International Journal of Climatology , vol. 40(3), pp. 1435-1455.  10.1002/joc.6278. \n\n\nThis study has addressed the spatiotemporal distribution of the daily rainfall concentration and its relation to the teleconnection patterns across the Mediterranean (MR). Daily concentration index (CI) and the ordered n index ( nor) are used at annual time scale to reveal the statistical structure of precipitation across the MR based on 233 daily rainfall series for the period 1975–2015. Eight teleconnection patterns, North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), Mediterranean Oscillation (MO), Western Mediterranean Oscillation (WeMO), Upper-Level Mediterranean Oscillation index (ULMO), East Atlantic (EA) pattern, East Atlantic/West Russia (EATL/WRUS) pattern, Scandinavia (SCAND) pattern and Southern Oscillation (SO) at annual time scale are selected. The spatiotemporal patterns in precipitation concentration indices, annual precipitation and their teleconnections with previous large-scale circulations are investigated. Results show a strong connection between the CI and the nor (r = 0.70, p  .05) which present the same relative areas of high and low concentration. The annual values range from 0.57 to 0.70 for CI and 0.49 to 0.71 for nor index which show a high daily precipitation concentration across the MR. Trend analysis demonstrated mostly significant increasing trends for both indices. This increase is mainly found in south France, northern coastlands of the Iberian Peninsula (IP), Greece and Tunisia. An inverse relationship between the number of rainy days and concentration indices is evident. Both of WeMO and MO can play an important role in modulating rainfall in the northwest Mediterranean. The positive EATL/WRUS phase is mainly connected with positive precipitation mean anomalies in the eastern Mediterranean and vice versa in the west. The high daily precipitation concentration values over south France, northeast Spain, Croatia and Tunisia are linked to the low values of WeMO and high values of EA. These results could pave the way for new possibilities regarding the projection of precipitation concentration and precipitation irregularity in downscaling techniques. precipitation concentration teleconnection patterns spatiotemporal variability mediterranean climate indices\n\n\nprecipitation concentrationteleconnection patternsspatiotemporal variabilitymediterraneanclimate indices\n\n\n\n\n\nLemus-Canovas M, Lopez-Bustins J, Martin-Vide J, Royé D (2019). synoptReg: An R package for computing a synoptic climate classification and a spatial regionalization of environmental data. Environmental Modelling & Software , vol. 118, pp. 114-119.  10.1016/j.envsoft.2019.04.006. \n\n\nSpatial knowledge of the climatic or environmental variables associated with the most frequent circulation types is essential with regard to developing strategies to address the risk of avalanches, floods, soil erosion, air pollution or other natural hazards. In order to derive an environmental regionalization, we present an Open Source R package known as synoptReg, which combines the spatialization of environmental variables based on the atmospheric circulation types. The synoptReg package contains a set of functions which we will employ (1) to perform a PCA-based synoptic classification using an atmospheric variable; (2) to map the spatial distribution of the selected environmental variable based upon the circulation types; (3) to develop a spatial environmental regionalization based on the previous results. We illustrate the usefulness of the package for a case study in the Alps area. synoptic classification clustering environmental data regionalization circulation types\n\n\nsynoptic classificationclusteringenvironmental dataregionalizationcirculation types\n\n\n\n\n\nRoyé D, Zarrabeitia M, Fdez-Arroyabe P, Álvarez Gutiérrez A, Santurtún A (2019). Role of Apparent Temperature and Air Pollutants in Hospital Admissions for Acute Myocardial Infarction in the North of Spain. Revista Española de Cardiología , vol. 72(8), pp. 634-640.  10.1016/j.recesp.2018.05.032. \n\n\nIntroduction and objectives. The role of the environment on cardiovascular health is becoming more prominent in the context of global change. The aim of this study was to analyze the relationship between apparent temperature (AT) and air pollutants and acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and to study the temporal pattern of this disease and its associated mortality. Methods. We performed a time-series study of admissions for AMI in Cantabria between 2001 and 2015. The association between environmental variables (including a biometeorological index, AT) and AMI was analyzed using a quasi-Poisson regression model. To assess potential delayed and non-linear effects of these variables on AMI, a lag non-linear model was fitted in a generalized additive model. Results. The incidence rate and the mortality followed a downward trend during the study period (CC = –0.714; P = .0002). An annual pattern was found in hospital admissions (P = .005), with the highest values being registered in winter; a weekly trend was also identified, reaching a minimum during the weekends (P = .000005). There was an inverse association between AT and the number of hospital admissions due to AMI and a direct association with particulate matter with a diameter smaller than 10 μm. Conclusions. Hospital admissions for AMI followed a downward trend between 2007 and 2015. Mortality associated with admissions due to this diagnosis has decreased. Predictive factors for this disease were AT and particulate matter with a diameter smaller than 10 μm. apparent temperature air pollutants acute myocardial infarction hospital admissions particulate matter\n\n\napparent temperatureair pollutantsacute myocardial infarctionhospital admissionsparticulate matter\n\n\n\n\n\nRoyé D, Zarrabeitia M, Riancho J, Santurtún A (2019). A time series analysis of the relationship between apparent temperature, air pollutants and ischemic stroke in Madrid, Spain. Environmental Research , vol. 173, pp. 349-358.  10.1016/j.envres.2019.03.065. \n\n\nThe understanding of the role of environment on the pathogenesis of stroke is gaining importance in the context of climate change. This study analyzes the temporal pattern of ischemic stroke (IS) in Madrid, Spain, during a 13-year period (2001-2013), and the relationship between ischemic stroke (admissions and deaths) incidence and environmental factors on a daily scale by using a quasi-Poisson regression model. To assess potential delayed and non-linear effects of air pollutants and Apparent Temperature (AT), a biometeorological index which represents human thermal comfort on IS, a lag non-linear model was fitted in a generalized additive model. The mortality rate followed a downward trend over the studied period, however admission rates progressively increased. Our results show that both increases and decreases in AT had a marked relationship with IS deaths, while hospital admissions were only associated with low AT. When analyzing the cumulative effects (for lag 0-14 days), with an AT of 1.7 °C (percentile 5%) a RR of 1.20 (95% CI, 1.05-1.37) for IS mortality and a RR of 1.09 (95% CI, 0.91-1.29) for morbidity is estimated. Concerning gender differences, men show higher risks of mortality in low temperatures and women in high temperatures. No significant relationship was found between air pollutant concentrations and IS morbi-mortality, but this result must be interpreted with caution, since there are strong spatial fluctuations of the former between nearby geographical areas that make it difficult to perform correlation analyses. admissions air pollutants apparent temperature ischemic stroke mortality\n\n\nadmissionsair pollutantsapparent temperatureischemic strokemortality\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2018\n\n\n\nRoyé D, Lorenzo N, Rasilla D, Martí A (2018). Spatio‐temporal variations of cloud fraction based on circulation types in the Iberian Peninsula. International Journal of Climatology , vol. 39(3), pp. 1716-1732.  10.1002/joc.5914. \n\n\nThis paper presents the first systematic study of the relationships between atmospheric circulation types (CT) and cloud fraction (CF) over the whole Iberian Peninsula, using satellite data from the MODIS (MOD09GA and MYD09GA) cloud mask for the period 2001–2017. The high level of detail, in combination with a classification for circulation patterns, provides us with relevant information about the spatio-temporal variability of cloudiness and the main mechanisms affecting the genesis of clouds. The results show that westerly CTs are the most influential, followed by cyclonic types, in cloudiness in the west of the Iberian Peninsula. Westerly flows, however, do not affect the Mediterranean coastline, which is dominated by easterly CTs, suggesting that local factors such as convective processes, orography and proximity to a body of warm water could play a major role in cloudiness processes. The Cantabrian Coast also has a particularly characteristic cloudiness dominated by northerly CTs. In general, the results found in this study are in line with the few studies that exist on cloudiness in the Iberian Peninsula. Furthermore, the results are geographically consistent, showing links to synoptic forcing in terms of atmospheric circulation patterns and the impact of the Iberian Peninsula’s complex orography upon this element of the climate system. cloudiness circulation types variability orography synoptic forcing\n\n\ncloudinesscirculation typesvariabilityorographysynoptic forcing\n\n\n\n\n\nVélez A, Martin-Vide J, Royé D, Santaella O (2018). Spatial analysis of daily precipitation concentration in Puerto Rico. Theoretical and Applied Climatology , vol. 136, pp. 1347-1355.  10.1007/s0070401825501. \n\n\nThe present study analyzes spatial patterns of precipitation Concentration Index (CI) in Puerto Rico considering the daily precipitation data of 20 precipitation-gauging stations during 1971–2010. The South and East interior parts of Puerto Rico are characterized by higher CI and the West and North-West parts show lower CI. The annual CI and the rainy season CI show a gradient from South-East to North-West and the dry season CI shows a gradient from South to North. Another difference between the rainy season CI and dry season CI is that the former shows the lowest values of CI while the latter shows the highest values of CI. The different types of seasonal precipitation seem to play a major role on the spatial CI distribution. However, the local relief plays a major role in the spatial patterns due to the effect of the air circulation by the mountains. These findings can contribute to basin-scale water resource management (flooding, soil erosion, etc.) and conservation of the ecological environment. precipitation concentration spatial patterns concentration index (ci) seasonal variability climate change\n\n\nprecipitation concentrationspatial patternsconcentration index (ci)seasonal variabilityclimate change\n\n\n\n\n\nRiancho-Zarrabeitia L, Rasilla D, Royé D, Fdez-Arroyabe P, Santurtún A (2018). Kawasaki disease in Spanish paediatric population and synoptic weather types: an observational study. Rheumatology International , vol. 38(7), pp. 1259-1266.  10.1007/s00296-018-4066-5. \n\n\nKawasaki disease (KD) is a vasculitis of unelucidated pathogenesis that usually occurs in paediatric patients. In this study we analyse the temporal pattern and geographical distribution of the disease in Spain, and its relationship with atmospheric circulation patterns. We performed a retrospective study in which we collected all hospital admissions due to KD in the country between 2005 and 2015 and explored their relationship with demographic and geographical characteristics. Moreover, we calculated daily surface atmospheric patterns over Spain to study the relationship between weather types (WT) and KD Admissions. The average admission rate for KD in the paediatric population was 3.90 per 100,000, with a male to female ratio of 1.56:1. The highest rate of admissions was found in the 0-4-year-old group, with an incidence of 11.7 cases per 100,000. Admissions followed an annual cyclic pattern with a peak of incidence in January (p = 0.022) and a nadir in September. There was an upwards trend in the number of KD admissions in male sex during the study period (p = 0.004). However, there were marked geographical differences in the incidence rate. Finally, the analysis of the relationship between the WT and the number of admissions by KD revealed no statistically significant association. KD admissions follow a peculiar seasonal and spatial distribution, that suggest the involvement of environmental factors in the disease; however, the absence of an association with WT should be interpreted with caution and regional studies should be done to explore this relationship. kawasaki disease season trend weather types\n\n\nkawasaki diseaseseasontrendweather types\n\n\n\n\n\nRoyé D, Figueiras A, Taracido M (2018). Short‐term effects of heat and cold on respiratory drug use. A time‐series epidemiological study in A Coruña, Spain.  Pharmacoepidemiology and Drug Safety , vol. 27(6), pp. 638-644. 10.1002/pds.4427. \n\n\nThe consumption of medication, especially over-the-counter drugs, can reflect environmental exposure with a lesser degree of severity in terms of morbidity. The non-linear effects of maximum and minimum apparent temperature on respiratory drug sales in A Coruña from 2006 to 2010 were examined using a distributed lag nonlinear model. In particular, low apparent temperatures proved to be associated with increased sales of respiratory drugs. The strongest consistent risk estimates were found for minimum apparent temperatures in respiratory drug sales with an increase of 33.4% (95% CI, 12.5%-58.0%) when the temperature changed from 2.8°C to −1.4 °C. These findings may serve to guide the planning of public health interventions to predict and manage the health effects of exposure to the thermal environment for lower degrees of morbidity. More precisely, significant increases in the use of measured over-the-counter medication could be used to identify and anticipate influenza outbreaks due to a more sensitive degree of the data source. respiratory drug use heat cold time-series analysis a coruña\n\n\nrespiratory drug useheatcoldtime-series analysisa coruña\n\n\n\n\n\nRoyé D, Lorenzo N, Martin-Vide J (2018). Spatial–temporal patterns of cloudtoground lightning over the northwest Iberian Peninsula during the period 2010–2015. Natural Hazards , vol. 92, pp. 857-884.  10.1007/s11069-018-3228-9. \n\n\nThe spatial–temporal patterns of cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning covering the period 2010–2015 over the northwest Iberian Peninsula were investigated. The analysis conducted employed three main methods: the circulation weather types developed by Jenkinson and Collison, the fit of a generalized additive model (GAM) for geographic variables, and the use of a concentration index for the ratio of lightning strikes and thunderstorm days. The main activity in the summer months can be attributed to situations with eastern or anticyclonic flow due to convection by insolation. In winter, lightning proves to have a frontal origin and is mainly associated with western or cyclonic flow situations which occur with advections of air masses of maritime origin. The largest number of CG discharges occurs under eastern flow and their hybrids with anticyclonic situations. Thunderstorms with greater CG lightning activity, highlighted by a higher concentration index, are located in areas with a higher density of lightning strikes, above all in mountainous areas away from the sea. The modeling of lightning density with geographic variables shows the positive influence of altitude and, particularly, distance to the sea, with nonlinear relationships due to the complex orography of the region. Likewise, areas with convex topography receive more lightning strikes than concave ones, a relation which has been demonstrated for the first time from a GAM. cloud-to-ground lightning spatial-temporal patterns northwest iberian peninsula circulation weather types generalized additive model (gam)\n\n\ncloud-to-ground lightningspatial-temporal patternsnorthwest iberian peninsulacirculation weather typesgeneralized additive model (gam)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2017\n\n\n\nRoyé D, Martin-Vide J (2017). Concentration of daily precipitation in the contiguous United States. Atmospheric Research , vol. 196(1), pp. 237-247.  10.1016/j.atmosres.2017.06.011. \n\n\nThe contiguous US exhibits a wide variety of precipitation regimes, first, because of the wide range of latitudes and altitudes. The physiographic units with a basic meridional configuration contribute to the differentiation between east and west in the country while generating some large interior continental spaces. The frequency distribution of daily precipitation amounts almost anywhere conforms to a negative exponential distribution, reflecting the fact that there are many small daily totals and few large ones. Positive exponential curves, which plot the cumulative percentages of days with precipitation against the cumulative percentage of the rainfall amounts that they contribute, can be evaluated through the Concentration Index. The Concentration Index has been applied to the contiguous United States using a gridded climate dataset of daily precipitation data, at a resolution of 0.25°, provided by CPC/NOAA/OAR/Earth System Research Laboratory, for the period between 1956 and 2006. At the same time, other rainfall indices and variables such as the annual coefficient of variation, seasonal rainfall regimes and the probabilities of a day with precipitation have been presented with a view to explaining spatial CI patterns. The spatial distribution of the CI in the contiguous United States is geographically consistent, reflecting the principal physiographic and climatic units of the country. Likewise, linear correlations have been established between the CI and geographical factors such as latitude, longitude and altitude. In the latter case the Pearson correlation coefficient (r) between this factor and the CI is −0.51 (p-value 0.001). For annual probability of days with precipitation and the CI there is also a significant and negative correlation, r = −0.25 (p-value 0.001). daily precipitation climate variability contiguous united states rainfall patterns hydrology\n\n\ndaily precipitationclimate variabilitycontiguous united statesrainfall patternshydrology\n\n\n\n\n\nMathbout S, Lopez-Bustins J A, Royé D, Martin-Vide J, Bech J, Rodrigo F S (2017). Observed Changes in Daily Precipitation Extremes at Annual Timescale Over the Eastern Mediterranean During 1961–2012. Pure and Applied Geophysics , vol. 175, pp. 3875-3890.  10.1007/s00024-017-1695-7. \n\n\nThe Eastern Mediterranean is one of the most prominent hot spots of climate change in the world and extreme climatic phenomena in this region such as drought or extreme rainfall events are expected to become more frequent and intense. In this study climate extreme indices recommended by the joint World Meteorological Organization Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices are calculated for daily precipitation data in 70 weather stations during 1961–2012. Observed trends and changes in daily precipitation extremes over the EM basin were analysed using the RClimDex package, which was developed by the Climate Research Branch of the Meteorological Service of Canada. Extreme and heavy precipitation events showed globally a statistically significant decrease in the Eastern Mediterranean and, in the southern parts, a significant decrease in total precipitation. The overall analysis of extreme precipitation indices reveals that decreasing trends are generally more frequent than increasing trends. We found statistically significant decreasing trends (reaching 74% of stations for extremely wet days) and increasing trends (reaching 36% of stations for number of very heavy precipitation days). Finally, most of the extreme precipitation indices have a statistically significant positive correlation with annual precipitation, particularly the number of heavy and very heavy precipitation days. precipitation extremes eastern mediterranean climate change hydrological cycle trend analysis\n\n\nprecipitation extremeseastern mediterraneanclimate changehydrological cycletrend analysis\n\n\n\n\n\nRoyé D (2017). The effects of hot nights on mortality in Barcelona, Spain. International Journal of Biometeorology , vol. 61, pp. 2127-2140.  10.1007/s00484-017-1416-z. \n\n\nHeat-related effects on mortality have been widely analyzed using maximum and minimum temperatures as exposure variables. Nevertheless, the main focus is usually on the former with the minimum temperature being limited in use as far as human health effects are concerned. Therefore, new thermal indices were used in this research to describe the duration of night hours with air temperatures higher than the 95% percentile of the minimum temperature (hot night hours) and intensity as the summation of these air temperatures in degrees (hot night degrees). An exposure-response relationship between mortality due to natural, respiratory, and cardiovascular causes and summer night temperatures was assessed using data from the Barcelona region between 2003 and 2013. The non-linear relationship between the exposure and response variables was modeled using a distributed lag non-linear model. The estimated associations for both exposure variables and mortality shows a relationship with high and medium values that persist significantly up to a lag of 1–2 days. In mortality due to natural causes, an increase of 1.1% per 10% (CI95% 0.6–1.5) for hot night hours and 5.8% per each 10° (CI95% 3.5–8.2%) for hot night degrees is observed. The effects of hot night hours reach their maximum with 100% and lead to an increase by 9.2% (CI95% 5.3–13.1%). The hourly description of night heat effects reduced to a single indicator in duration and intensity is a new approach and shows a different perspective and significant heat-related effects on human health. hot nights mortality barcelona heat stress public health\n\n\nhot nightsmortalitybarcelonaheat stresspublic health\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2015\n\n\n\nRoyé D (2015).

A widespread format is netCDF allowing a multidimensional structure and an exchange of data machine independently. In this article, we introduce the use of these databases with the free software environment R. To do this, we will work with a grid of the maximum temperature of the Iberian Peninsula for the period 1971-2007. The goal is to read and visualize the netCDF format, and make some fist overall and specifi calculations. Finally the applicability is shown in a case study: the diurnal temperature variation in the Iberian Peninsula for January and August 2006.

Analysis of tropical nights on the atlantic coast of the Iberian Peninsula. A proposed methodology.  Boletín de la Asociación de Geógrafos Españoles , vol. 69, pp. 351-368. 10.21138/bage.1900. \n\n\nAnalysis of tropical nights on the Atlantic coast of the Iberian peninsula. A proposed methodology. This paper presents a new methodology for the study of warm nights, also called «tropical», in Galicia and Portugal in order to identify those nights where people can be affected by heat stress. The use of two indicators obtained through half-hourly data has allowed us to define in more detail the thermal characteristics of the nights between May and October, thereby being able to more accurately assess the risk to the health and well-being of the population. There is a significant increase in the frequency of tropical nights and warm nights on the Atlantic coast, from the north of Galicia to the south of Portugal. The lower latitude and proximity to the coastline are associated with greater persistence of heat and thermal stress during these nights. In inland areas the persistence is less. The warmest nights are more frequent and intense in centres of the cities, due to the effect of the urban heat island. tropical nights atlantic coast iberian peninsula heat stress climate change\n\n\ntropical nightsatlantic coastiberian peninsulaheat stressclimate change\n\n\n\n\n\nRoyé D, Taboada J J, Martí A, Lorenzo M N (2015). Winter circulation weather types and hospital admissions for respiratory diseases in Galicia, Spain. International Journal of Biometeorology , vol. 60.  10.1007/s00484-015-1047-1. \n\n\nThe link between various pathologies and atmospheric conditions has been a constant topic of study over recent decades in many places across the world; knowing more about it enables us to pre-empt the worsening of certain diseases, thereby optimizing medical resources. This study looked specifically at the connections in winter between respiratory diseases and types of atmospheric weather conditions (Circulation Weather Types, CWT) in Galicia, a region in the north-western corner of the Iberian Peninsula. To do this, the study used hospital admission data associated with these pathologies as well as an automatic classification of weather types. The main result obtained was that weather types giving rise to an increase in admissions due to these diseases are those associated with cold, dry weather, such as those in the east and south-east, or anticyclonic types. A second peak was associated with humid, hotter weather, generally linked to south-west weather types. In the future, this result may help to forecast the increase in respiratory pathologies in the region some days in advance. circulation weather types (cwt) respiratory diseases hospital admissions galicia winter\n\n\ncirculation weather types (cwt)respiratory diseaseshospital admissionsgaliciawinter"

La actual proliferación de servicios de Open Data, despliegues de sensores y diversas fuentes, incluyendo los satélites, dificulta su procesamiento en equipos personales. El gran crecimiento en grandes volúmenes de datos espaciotemporales de tipo vectorial o raster lleva a la necesidad en trabajar con servicios en nube para ahorrar tiempo computacional y espacio de almacenamiento. En la actualidad existen diferentes servicios de geoprocesamiento en nube que ayudan a hacer análisis online sin necesidad de descargar los datos ni preocuparse por el rendimiento computacional. Uno de estos servicios es Google Earth Engine (GEE), donde se combina un catálogo de varios petabytes de imágenes satelitales y conjuntos de datos geoespaciales multidimensionales (vectorial y raster) de alta resolución con capacidades de análisis a escala planetaria. Este servicio gratuito para uso no comercial incluye incluso la posibilidad de crear aplicaciones.\n\n\n,\n\n\n\n\n\nRoyé D (2024). Una nota sobre el cambio climático. Fundamentos de ciencia de datos con R Publisher: Mc Graw Hill Editors: G Fernández-Avilés, JM Montero. https://cdr-book.github.io/cambioclimatico.html . \n\n\nLa temperatura media global en la superficie terrestre ha aumentado en 1,1 C desde la era preindustrial (1880-1900). A pesar de parecer un leve incremento en la temperatura, implica un aumento significativo en el calor acumulado del sistema Tierra. Cuando se combina el aumento de la temperatura en la superficie terrestre y en la superficie oceánica, la tasa de incremento promedio es de 0,08 C por década desde 1880. Sin embargo, la tasa promedio de aumento desde 1981 ha sido más del doble: 0,18 C por año. Los océanos se caracterizan por una menor tasa de calentamiento debido a su capacidad calorífica. No obstante, son los océanos los que absorben la mayoría del calor adicional del planeta debido al cambio climático…\n\n\n,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2020\n\n\n\nTedim F, Leone V, Coughlan M, Bouillon C, Xanthopoulos G, Royé D, Correia FJM, Ferreira C (2020). Extreme wildfire events: the definition. 10.1016/B978-0-12-815721-3.00001-1. https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-815721-3.00001-1 \n\n\nExtreme wildfires events (EWEs) represent a minority among all wildfires but are a true challenge for societies as they exceed the current control capacity even in the best prepared regions of the world and they create destruction and a disproportionately number of fatalities. Recent events in Portugal, Chile, Greece, Australia, Canada, and the USA provide evidence that EWEs are an escalating worldwide problem, exceeding all previous records. Despite the challenges put by climate change, the occurrence of EWEs and disasters is not an ecological inevitability. In this chapter the rationale of the definition of EWEs and the integration of potential consequences on people and assets in a novel wildfire classification scheme are proposed and discussed. They are excellent instruments to enhance wildfire risk and crisis communication programs and to define appropriate prevention, mitigation, and response measures which are crucial to build up citizens’ safety. extreme wildfire events (ewes) climate change risk communication mitigation measures wildfire classification\n\n\nextreme wildfire events (ewes)climate changerisk communicationmitigation measureswildfire classification\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2017\n\n\n\nFdez-Arroyabe P, Royé D (2017).

Internet of Things and Big Data Technologies for Next Generation HealthcareEdition: Studies in Big Data, Vol.  23 Publisher: Springer International PublishingEditors: C. Bhatt, N. Dey, A.S. Ashour. \n\n\nCo-creation of scientific knowledge based on new technologies and big data sources is one of the main challenges for the digital society in the XXI century. Data management and the analysis of patterns among datasets based on machine learning and artificial intelligence has become essential for many sectors nowadays. The development of real time health-related climate services represents an example where abundant structured and unstructured information and transdisciplinary research are needed. The study of the interactions between atmospheric processes and human health through a big data approach can reveal the hidden value of data. The Oxyalert technological platform is presented as an example of a digital biometeorological infrastructure able to forecast, at an individual level, oxygen changes impacts on human health. co-creation interdisciplinarity transdisciplinarity morbidity climate services digital divide big data health\n\n\nco-creationinterdisciplinaritytransdisciplinaritymorbidityclimate servicesdigital dividebig datahealth"
